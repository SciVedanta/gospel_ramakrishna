<p>WITH VARIOUS DEVOTEES</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sunday, October 26, 1884</p>
</blockquote>
<p>IT WAS AFTERNOON, and many devotees were present in the Master\'s room.
Among them were Manomohan,</p>
<p>Mahimacharan, and M. They were joined later by Ishan and Hazra. Balarām
and Rākhāl were still staying at</p>
<p>Vrindāvan. The many young boys who at this time began to seek the
Master\'s company later became his</p>
<p>intimate disciples. Lātu lived with the Master, and Jogin, who lived in
the village, was a frequent visitor.</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna, happy child of the Divine Mother that he was, radiated
a joy and peace that were reflected in the hearts of his devotees and
found expression in their happy faces. They were seated on the floor and
had their eyes fixed on the Master, who was standing in a pensive mood,
like a boy.</p>
<p><strong>God in all beings</strong></p>
<p>MASTER (to Manomohan): \"I see Rāma in all things. You are all sitting
here, but I see only Rāma in everyone of you.\"</p>
<p>MANOMOHAN: \"Yes, sir. It is Rāma who has become everything. But, as you
say, though all water is Narayana, yet some water is fit for drinking,
some for washing the hands and face, and some only for cleaning pots and
pans.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"It is true. But I see that it is God Himself who has become
everything-the universe and its living beings.\"</p>
<p>Presently the Master sat down on the small couch near his bed.</p>
<p>MASTER (to Mahimacharan): \"There is no question of my being truthful;
but must I develop a mania for it? If I once say that I shall not eat,
then it is impossible for me to eat, even if I am hungry. Again, if I
ask a particular man to take my water-jug to the pine-grove, he alone
must carry it. If another man carries it, he will have to take it back.
What a fix I am in! Is there no way out of it?</p>
<p>\"Besides, I can\'t carry anything with me, neither food nor betel-leaf;
for that means laying up for the future. I can\'t carry a little clay in
my hand.\"</p>
<p>Just then a man entered the room and told the Master that Hriday was
waiting to see him in Jadu Mallick\'s garden, near the gate.</p>
<p>The Master said to the devotees: \"I shall have to see Hriday. Please
don\'t leave the room.\" He put on his slippers and went toward the east
gate of the temple garden, M. accompanying him. The road through the
garden was covered with red brick-dust. The manager of the temple, who
was standing on the road, saluted Sri Ramakrishna. The Master passed the
north entrance of the temple compound, where the bearded sentries sat.
On his left he passed the kuthi, the building used by the proprietors of
the temple. Then he walked on down the road which was lined on both
sides with flowering trees, passing the reservoir on his right, and went
outside the temple garden. He found Hriday waiting for him near the gate
of Jadu Mallick\'s garden.</p>
<p><strong>God in all beings</strong></p>
<p>At the sight of the Master, Hriday, who had been standing there with
folded hands, prostrated himself before him. When the Master told him to
get up, he rose and began to cry like a child. How strange! Tears also
appeared in the Master\'s eyes. He wiped them away with his hands.
Hriday had made him suffer endless agonies, yet the Master wept for him.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Why are you here now?\"</p>
<p>HRIDAY (weeping): \"I have come to see you. To whom else shall I tell my
sorrows?\"</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna smiled and said to him by way of consolation: \"One
cannot avoid such sorrows in the world.</p>
<p>Pleasure and pain are inevitable in worldly life. (Pointing to M.) That
is why they come here now and then.</p>
<p>They get peace of mind by hearing about God. What is your trouble?\"</p>
<p>HRIDAY (weeping): \"I am deprived of your company and so I suffer.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Why, was it not you who said to me, \'You follow your ideal
and let me follow mine\'?\"</p>
<p>HRIDAY: \"Yes, I did say that. But what did I know?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"I shall say good-bye to you now. Come another day and we shall
talk together. Today is Sunday and many people have come to see me. They
are waiting in my room. Have you had a good crop in the country?\"</p>
<p>HRIDAY: \'It isn\'t bad.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Let me say good-bye. Come another day.\"</p>
<p>Hriday again prostrated himself before the Master, who started back to
his room with M.</p>
<p>MASTER (to M.): \"He tormented me as much as he served me. When my
stomach trouble had reduced my</p>
<p>body to a couple of bones and I couldn\'t eat anything, he said to me
one day: \'Look at me-how well I eat! You\'ve just taken a fancy that
you can\'t eat.\' Again he said: \'You are a fool! If I weren\'t living
with you, where would your profession of holiness be?\' One day he
tormented me so much that I stood on the embankment ready to give up my
body by jumping into the Ganges, which was then at flood-tide.\"</p>
<p>M. became speechless at these words of the Master. For such a man he had
shed tears a few minutes before!</p>
<p>MASTER (to M.): \"Well, he served me a great deal; then why should he
have fallen on such evil days? He took care of me like a parent bringing
up a child. As for me, I would remain unconscious of the world day and
night. Besides, I was ill for a long time. I was completely at his
mercy.\"</p>
<p>M. did not know how to answer Sri Ramakrishna; so he kept silent.</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna returned to his room and sat On the small couch. The
devotees had been waiting for him eagerly. Several devotees from
Konnagar had arrived. One of them came forward to question the Master.</p>
<p><strong>Bhava and Mahabhava</strong></p>
<p>DEVOTEE: \"Sir, we hear that you go into samādhi and experience ecstasy.
Please explain why and how you get into that mood.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Sri Radha used to experience Mahabhava. If any of her
companions wanted to touch her while she was in that state, another of
them would say: \'Please do not touch that body, the playground of Sri
Krishna. Krishna is now sporting in her body.\' It is not possible to
experience bhava or mahabhava without the realization of God. When a
fish comes up from a great depth, you see a movement on the surface of
the water; and if it is a big one there is much splashing about. That is
why a devotee \'laughs and weeps and dances and sings in the ecstasy of
God\'.</p>
<p>\"One cannot remain in bhava very long. People take a man to be crazy if
he sits before a mirror and looks at his face all the time.\"</p>
<p><strong>Discipline for God-vision</strong></p>
<p>DEVOTEE: \"Sir, we hear that you see God. If you do, please show Him to
us.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Everything depends on God\'s will. What can a man do? While
chanting God\'s name, sometimes tears flow and at other times the eyes
remain dry. While meditating on God, some days I feel a great deal of
inner awakening, and some days I feel nothing.</p>
<p>\"A man must work. Only then can he see God. One day, in an exalted
mood, I had a vision of the Haldārpukur. I saw a low-caste villager
drawing water after pushing aside the green scum. Now and then he took
up the water in the palm of his hand and examined it. In that vision it
was revealed to me that the water cannot be seen without pushing aside
the green scum that covers it; that is to say, one cannot develop love
of God or obtain His vision without work. Work means meditation, japa,
and the like. The chanting of God\'s name and glories is work too. You
may also include charity, sacrifice, and so on.</p>
<p>\"If you want butter, you must let the milk turn to curd. It must be
left in a quiet place. When the milk becomes curd, you must work hard to
churn it. Only then can you get butter from the milk.\"</p>
<p><strong>Futility of mere study</strong></p>
<p>MAHIMACHARAN: \"That is true, sir. Work is certainly necessary. One must
labour hard. Only then does one succeed. There is so much to read! The
scriptures are endless.\"</p>
<p>MASTER (to Mahimacharan): \"How much of the scriptures can you read?
What will you gain by mere reasoning? Try to realize God before anything
else. Have faith in the guru\'s words, and work. If you have no guru,
then pray to God with a longing heart. He will let you know what He is
like.</p>
<p>\"What will you learn of God from books? As long as you are at a
distance from the market-place you hear only an indistinct roar. But it
is quite different when you are actually there. Then you hear and see
everything distinctly. You hear people saying: \'Here are your potatoes.
Take them and give me the money.\' \"From a distance you hear only the
rumbling noise of the ocean. Go near it and you will see many boats
sailing about, birds flying, and waves rolling.</p>
<p>\"One cannot get true feeling about God from the study of books. This
feeling is something very different from book-learning. Books,
scriptures, and science appear as mere dirt and straw after the
realization of God.</p>
<p>\"The one thing needful is to be introduced to the master of the house.
Why are you so anxious to know beforehand how many houses and gardens,
and how many government securities, the master possesses? The servants
of the house would not allow you even to approach these, and they would
certainly not tell you about their master\'s investments. Therefore,
somehow or other become acquainted with the master, even if you have to
jump over the fence or take a few pushes from the servants. Then the
master himself will tell you all about his houses and gardens and his
government securities. And what is more, the servants and the
door-keeper will salute you when you are known to the master.\' (All
laugh.)</p>
<p><strong>Yearning for God</strong></p>
<p>DEVOTEE: \"Now the question is how to become acquainted with the
master.\" (Laughter.)</p>
<p>MASTER: \"That is why I say that work is necessary. It will not do to
say that God exists and then idle away your time. You must reach God
somehow or other. Call on Him in solitude and pray to Him, \'O Lord!
reveal Thyself to me.\' Weep for Him with a longing heart. You roam
about in search of \'woman and gold\' like a madman; now be a little mad
for God. Let people say, \'This man has lost his head for God.\' Why not
renounce everything for a few days and call on God in solitude?</p>
<p><strong>Work hard for His realization</strong></p>
<p>\"What will you achieve by simply saying that God exists and doing
nothing about it? There are big fish in the Haldārpukur; but can you
catch them by merely sitting idly on the bank? Prepare some spiced bait
and throw it into the lake. Then the fish will come from the deep water
and you will see ripples. That will make you happy. Perhaps a fish will
jump with a splash and you will get a glimpse of it. Then you will be so
glad!</p>
<p>\"Milk must be turned to curd and the curd must be churned. Only then
will you get butter. (To Mahima) What a nuisance! Someone must show God
to a man, while he himself sits idly by all the while! Someone must
extract the butter and hold it in front of his mouth! (All laugh.) What
a bother! Someone else must catch the fish and give it to him!</p>
<p>\"A man wanted to see the king. The king lived in the inner court of the
palace, beyond seven gates. No sooner did the man pass the first gate
than he exclaimed, \'Oh, where is the king?\' But there were seven
gates, and he must pass them one after another before he could see the
king.\"</p>
<p>MAHIMACHARAN: \"By what kind of work can one realize God?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"It is not that God can be realized by this work and not by
that. The vision of God depends on His grace. Still a man must work a
little with longing for God in his heart. If he has longing he will
receive the grace of God.</p>
<p><strong>Favourable conditions for realization of God</strong></p>
<p>\"To attain God a man must have certain favourable conditions: the
company of holy men, discrimination, and the blessings of a real
teacher. Perhaps his elder brother takes the responsibility for the
family; perhaps his wife has spiritual qualities and is very virtuous;
perhaps he is not married at all or entangled in worldly life. He
succeeds when conditions like these are fulfilled.</p>
<p>\"In a certain family a man lay seriously ill. He was at the point of
death. Someone said: \'Here is a remedy: First it must rain when the
star Svati is in the ascendant; then some of that rain-water must
collect in a human skull; then a frog must come there and a snake must
chase it; and as the frog is about to be bitten by the snake, it must
jump away and the poison of the snake must drop into the skull. You must
prepare a medicine from this poison and give it to the patient. Then he
will live.\' The head of the family consulted the almanac about the star
and set out at the right moment. With great longing of heart he began to
search for the different ingredients. He prayed to God, \'O Lord, I
shall succeed only if You bring together all the ingredients.\' As he
was roaming about he actually saw a skull lying on the ground. Presently
there came a shower of rain. Then the man exclaimed: \'O gracious Lord,
I have got the rain-water under Svati, and the skull too. What is more,
some of the rain has fallen into the skull. Now be kind enough to bring
together the other ingredients.\' He was reflecting with a yearning
heart when he saw a poisonous snake approaching. His joy knew no bounds.
He became so excited that he could feel the thumping of his own heart.
\'O God,\' he prayed, \'now the snake has come too. I have procured most
of the ingredients. Please be gracious and give me the remaining ones.\'
No sooner did he pray thus than a frog hopped up. The snake pursued it.
As they came near the skull and the snake was about to bite the frog,
the frog jumped over the skull and the snake\'s poison fell into it. The
man began to dance, clapping his hands for joy. So I say that one gets
everything through yearning.</p>
<p>\"A man cannot realize God unless he renounces everything mentally. A
sādhu cannot lay things up. \'Birds and wandering monks do not make
provision for the morrow.\' Such is the state of my mind that I cannot
carry even clay in my hand. Once, when Hriday tormented me, I thought of
leaving this place and going to Benares. I thought of taking some
clothes with me. But how could I take money? So I could not go to
Benares. (All laugh.)</p>
<p>(To Mahima) \"You are a householder. Therefore you should hold bothto
\'this\' and to \'that\'-both to the world and to God.\"</p>
<p>MAHlMA: \"Sir, can one who holds to \'that\' also hold to \'this\'?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Once, sitting on the bank of the Ganges neat the Panchavati,
holding a rupee in one hand and clay in the other, I discriminated,
\'The rupee is the clay-the clay is verily the rupee, and the rupee is
verily the clay\', and then threw the rupee into the river. But I was a
little frightened. \'How foolish of me to offend the goddess of
fortune!\' I thought. \'What shall I do if she doesn\'t provide me with
food any more?\' Then, like</p>
<p>Hazra, I sought help in a ruse. I said to the goddess, \'Mother, may you
dwell in my heart.\' Once the Divine Mother was pleased with a man\'s
austerities and said to him, \'You may ask a favour of Me.\' \'O
Mother,\' said he, \'if You are so pleased. with me, then grant that I
may eat from a gold plate with my grandchildren.\' Now, in one boon the
man got everything: grandchildren, wealth, and gold plate. (All laugh.)</p>
<p>\"When the mind is freed from \'woman and gold\', it can be directed to
God and become absorbed in Him. It is the bound alone who can be freed.</p>
<p>The moment the mind \'turns away from God, it is bound. When does the
lower needle of a pair of scales move away from the upper one? When one
pan is pressed down by a weight. \'Woman and gold\' is the weight.</p>
<p>\"Why does a child cry on coming out of its mother\'s womb? With its cry
it says, as it were: \'Just see where I am now! In my mother\'s womb I
was meditating on the Lotus Feet of God; but see where I am now!\'</p>
<p>(To Mahima) \"You should renounce mentally. Live the life of a house
holder in a spirit of detachment.\"</p>
<p>MAHIMA: \"Can a man live in the world if his mind is once directed to
God?\"</p>
<p><strong>See God in the world</strong></p>
<p>MASTER: \"Why not? Where will he go away from the world? I realize that
wherever I live I am always in the Ayodhya of Rāma. This whole world is
Rāma\'s Ayodhya. After receiving instruction from His teacher, Rāma said
that He would renounce the world. Daśaratha sent the sage Vasishtha to
Rāma to dissuade Him. Vasishtha found Him filled with intense
renunciation. He said to Rāma: \'First of all, reason with me, Rāma;
then You may leave the world. May I ask You if this world is outside,
God? If that is so, then You may give it up.\' Rāma found that it is God
alone who has become the universe and all its living beings. Everything
in the world appears real on account of God\'s reality behind it.
Thereupon Rāma became silent.</p>
<p>\"In the world a man must fight against passions like lust and anger,
against many desires, against attachment. It is convenient to fight from
inside a fort-from his own home. At home he gets his food and other help
from his wife. In the Kaliyuga the life of a man depends entirely on
food. It is better to get food at one place than to knock at seven doors
for it. Living at home is like facing the battle from a fort.</p>
<p>\"Live in the world like a cast-off leaf in a gale. Such a leaf is
sometimes blown inside a house and sometimes to a rubbish heap. The leaf
goes wherever the wind blows-sometimes to a good place and sometimes to
a bad. Now God has put you in the world. That is good. Stay here. Again,
when He lifts you from here and puts you in a better place, that will be
time enough to think about what to do then.</p>
<p>\"God has put you in the world. What can you do about it? Resign
everything to Him. Surrender yourself at His feet. Then there will be no
more confusion. Then you will realize that it is God who does
everything. All depends on \'the will of Rāma\'.\"</p>
<p><strong>Story of \"the will of Rāma\"</strong></p>
<p>A DEVOTEE: \"What is that story about \'the will of Rāma\'?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"In a certain village there lived a weaver. He was a very
pious,soul. Everyone trusted him and loved him. He used to sell his
goods in the market-place. When a customer asked him the price of a
piece of cloth, the weaver would say: \'By the will of Rāma the price of
the yarn is one rupee and the labour four <em>ānnās</em> ; by the will of Rāma
the profit is two <em>ānnās</em> . The price of the cloth, by the will of Rāma,
is one rupee and six <em>ānnās</em> .\' Such was the people\'s faith in the
weaver that the customer would at once pay the price and take the cloth.
The weaver was a real devotee of God. After finishing his supper in the
evening, he would spend long hours\' in the worship hall meditating on
God and chanting His name and glories. Now, late one night the weaver
couldn\'t get to sleep. He was sitting in the worship hall, smoking now
and then, when a band of robbers happened to pass that way. They wanted
a man to carry their goods and said to the weaver, \'Come with us.\' So
saying, they led him off by the hand. After committing a robbery in a
house, they put a load of</p>
<p>things on the weaver\'s head, commanding him to carry them. Suddenly the
police arrived and the robbers ran away. But the weaver, with his load,
was arrested. He was kept in the lock-up for the night. Next day he was
brought before the magistrate for trial. The villagers learnt what had
happened and came to court. They said to the magistrate, \'Your Honour,
this man could never commit a robbery.\' Thereupon the magistrate asked
the weaver to make his statement.</p>
<p>\'The weaver said: \'Your Honour, by the will of Rāma I finished my meal
at night. Then by the will of Rāma I was sitting in the worship hall. It
was quite late at night by the will of Rāma. By the will of Rāma I had
been thinking of God and chanting His name and glories, when by the will
of Rāma a band of robbers passed that way. By the will of Rāma they
dragged me with them; by the will of Rāma they committed a robbery in a
house; and by the will of Rāma they put a load on my head. Just then, by
the will of Rāma the police arrived, and by the will of Rāma I was
arrested. Then by the will of Rāma the police kept me in the lock-up for
the night, and this morning by the will of Rāma I have been brought
before Your Honour.\' The magistrate realized that the weaver was a
pious man and ordered his release. On his way home the weaver said to
his friends, \'By the will of Rāma I have been released.\'</p>
<p>\"Whether a man should be a householder or a monk depends on the will of
Rāma. Surrender everything to God and do your duties in the world. What
else can you do? A clerk was once sent to prison. After the prison term
was over he was released. Now, what do you think he did? Cut capers or
do his old clerical work?</p>
<p>\"If the householder becomes a jivanmukta, then he can easily live in
the world if he likes. A man who has attained Knowledge does not
differentiate between \'this place\' and \'that place\'. All places are
the same to him. He who thinks of \'that place\' also thinks of \'this
place\'.</p>
<p><strong>Master\'s first meeting with Keshab</strong></p>
<p>\"When I first met Keshab at Jaygopal\'s garden house, I remarked, \'He
is the only one who has dropped his tail.\' At this people laughed.
Keshab said to them: \'Don\'t laugh. There must be some meaning in his
words. Let us ask him.\' Thereupon I said to Keshab: The tadpole, so
long as it has not dropped its tail, lives only in the water. It cannot
move about on dry land. But as soon as it drops its tail it hops out on
the bank; then it can live both on land and in water. Likewise, as long
as a man has not dropped his tail of ignorance, he can live only in the
water of the world. But when he drops his tail, that is to say, when he
attains the Knowledge of God, then he can roam about as a free soul, or
live as a householder if he likes.\' \"</p>
<p>Mahimacharan and. the other devotees remained spellbound, listening to
the Master\'s words.</p>
<p><strong>Master and Devendra Tagore</strong></p>
<p>MASTER: \"Once I visited Devendranath Tagore with Mathur Babu. I said to
Mathur: \'I have heard that Devendra Tagore thinks of God. I should like
to see him.\' \'All right,\' said Mathur, \'I will take you to him. We
were fellow students in the Hindu College and. I am very friendly with
him.\' We went to Devendra\'s house. Mathur and Devendra had not seen
each other for a long time. Devendra said to Mathur: \'You have changed
a little. You have grown fat around the stomach.\' Mathur said,
referring to me: \'He has come to see you. He is always mad about God.\'
I wanted to see Devendra\'s physical marks and said to him, \'Let me see
your body.\' He pulled up his shirt, and I found that he had very fair
skin tinted red. His hair had not yet turned grey.</p>
<p>\"At the outset I noticed a little vanity in Devendra. And isn\'t that
natural? He had such wealth, such scholarship, such name and fame!
Noticing that streak of vanity, I asked Mathur: \'Well, is vanity the
outcome of knowledge or ignorance? Can a knower of Brahman have such a
feeling as, \"I am a scholar; I am a Jnāni; I am rich\"?\'</p>
<p>\"While I was talking to Devendra, I suddenly got into that state of
mind in which I can see a man as he really is. I was convulsed with
laughter inside. In that state I regard scholars and the book-learned as
mere straw. If I see that a scholar has no discrimination and
renunciation, I regard him as worthless straw. I see that he is like a
vulture, which soars high but fixes its look on a charnel-pit down
below.</p>
<p>\"I found that Devendra had combined both yoga and bhoga in his life. He
had a number of children, all young. The family physician was there.
Thus, you see, though he was a Jnāni, yet he was preoccupied with
worldly life. I said to him: \'You are the King Janaka of this Kaliyuga.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Holding to one as well as the other,</em></p>
<p><em>He drank his milk from a brimming cup!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have heard that you live in the world and think of God; so I have come
to see you. Please tell me something about God.\'</p>
<p>\"He recited some texts from the Vedas. He said, \'This universe is like
a chandelier and each living being is a light in it.\' Once, meditating
in the Panchavati, I too, had had a vision like that. I found his words
agreed with my vision, and I thought he must be very great man. I asked
him to explain his words. He said: \'God has created men to manifest His
own glory; otherwise, who could know this universe? Everything becomes
dark without the lights in the chandelier. One cannot even see the
chandelier itself.\'</p>
<p>\"We talked a long time. Devendra was pleased and said to me, \'You must
come to our Brahmo Samaj festival.\' \'That\', I said, \'depends on the
will of God. You can see the state of my mind. There\'s no knowing when
God will put me into a particular state.\' Devendra insisted: \'No, you
must come. \'But put on your cloth and wear a shawl over your body.
Someone might say something. unkind about your untidiness, and that
would hurt me.\' \'No,\' I replied, \'I cannot promise that. I cannot be
a babu.\' Devendra and Mathur laughed.</p>
<p>\"The very next day Mathur received a letter from Devendra forbidding me
to go to the festival. He wrote that it would be ungentlemanly of me not
to cover my body with a shawl. (All laugh.)</p>
<p><strong>Colonel Viswanath</strong></p>
<p>\"There is another big man: Captain. Though a man of the world, he is a
great lover of God. (To Mahima) Talk to him some time. He knows the
Vedas, the Vedānta , the Bhagavata, the Gitā, the Adhyātma Rāmāyana, and
other scriptures by heart. You will find that out when you talk to him.</p>
<p>\"He has great piety. Once I was going along a street in Baranagore and
he held an umbrella over my head. He invites me to his house and shows
me great attention. He fans me, massages my feet, and feeds me with
various dishes. Once at his house I went into samādhi in the toilet; and
he took care of me there though he is so particular about his orthodox
habits. He didn\'t show any abhorrence for the place.</p>
<p>\"He has many expenses. He supports his brothers who live in Benares.
His wife was a miserly woman at first.</p>
<p>Now she is so burdened by the expenses of the family that she cannot
spend all the money she would like to.</p>
<p>\"Captain\'s wife said to me: \'He doesn\'t enjoy worldly life. That is
why he once said he would renounce the world.\' True, every now and then
he expressed that desire.</p>
<p>\"Captain was born in a family of devotees. His father was a soldier. I
have heard that on the battle-field he would worship Śiva with one hand
and hold a naked sword in the other.</p>
<p>\"Captain is a strong upholder of orthodox conventions. Because of my
visiting Keshab Chandra Sen, he stopped coming here for a month. He said
to me that Keshab had violated the social conventions: he dined with the
English, had married his daughter into another caste, and had lost his
own caste. I said to Captain: \'What do I care for such things? Keshab
chants the name of God; so I go to him to hear about God. I eat only the
plum; what do I care about the thorns?\' But Captain remained stubborn.
He said to me, \'Why do you see Keshab?\' I answered him rather sharply:
\'But I don\'t go to him for money; I go there to hear the name of God;
And how is it that you visit the Viceroy\'s house? He is a mlechchha.
How can you be in his company?\' That silenced him a little.</p>
<p>\"But he is a great devotee. When he worships he performs <em>Ārati</em> with
camphor. When he recites hymns he</p>
<p>becomes a totally different person. He becomes absorbed.</p>
<p><strong>Essence of Vedānta</strong></p>
<p>(To Mahimacharan) \"In the light of Vedantic reasoning the world is
illusory, unreal as a dream. The Supreme Soul is the Witness-the witness
of the three states of waking, dream, and deep sleep. These things are
in your line of thought. The waking state is only as real as the dream.
Let me tell you a story that agrees with your attitude.</p>
<p>\"There was a farmer. who lived in the countryside. He was a real Jnāni.
He earned his living by farming. He was married, and after many years a
son was born to him, whom he named Haru. The parents loved the boy
dearly. This was natural, since he was the one precious gem in the
family. On account of his religious nature the farmer was loved by the
villagers. One day he was working in the field when a neighbour came and
told him that Haru had had an attack of cholera. The farmer at once
returned home and arranged for treatment for the boy. But Haru died. The
other members of the family were grief-stricken, but the farmer acted as
if nothing had happened. He consoled his family and told them that
grieving was futile. Then he went back to his field. On returning home
he found his wife weeping even more bitterly. She said to him: \"How
heartless you are! You haven\'t shed one tear for the child.\' The
farmer replied quietly: \'Shall I tell you why I haven\'t wept? I had a
very vivid dream last night. I dreamt I had become a king; I was the
father of eight sons and was very happy with them. Then I woke up. Now I
am greatly perplexed. Should I weep for those eight sons or for this one
Haru?\'</p>
<p>\'The farmer was a Jnāni; therefore he realized that the waking state is
as unreal as the dream state. There is only one eternal Substance, and
that is the Ātman.</p>
<p>\"But for my part I accept everything: Turiya and also the three states
of waking, dream; and deep sleep. I accept all three states. I accept
all- Brahman and also māyā, the universe, and its living beings. If I
accepted less I should not get the full weight.\"</p>
<p>A DEVOTEE: \"The full weight? How is that?\" (All laugh.)</p>
<p><strong>Qualified Advaita</strong></p>
<p>MASTER: \" Brahman is qualified by the universe and its living beings.
Atthe beginning, while following the method of \'Not this, not this\',
one has to eliminate the universe and its living beings. But as long as
\'I-consciousness\' remains, one cannot but feel that it is God Himself
who has become everything. He alone has become the twenty-four cosmic
principles.</p>
<p>\"When a man speaks of the essential part of the bel-fruit, he means its
flesh only, and not the seeds and shell. But if he wants to speak of the
total weight of the fruit, it will not do for him to weigh only the
flesh. He must accept the whole thing: seeds and shell and flesh. Seeds
and shell and flesh belong to one and the same fruit.</p>
<p><strong>Synthesis of Sankara and Ramanuja</strong></p>
<p>\"The Nitya and the Lila belong to the same Reality. Therefore I accept
everything, the Relative as well as the Absolute. I don\'t explain away
the world as māyā. Were I to do that I should get short weight.\"</p>
<p>MAHIMACHARAN: \"It is a good synthesis: from the Absolute to the
Relative, and from the Relative to the Absolute.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \'The jnanis regard everything as illusory, like a dream; but
the bhaktas accept all the states. The milk flows only in dribblets from
the Jnāni. (All laugh.) There are some cows that pick and choose their
fodder; hence their milk flows only in dribblets. But cows that don\'t
discriminate so much, and eat whatever they get, give milk in torrents.
A superior devotee of God accepts both the Absolute and the Relative;
therefore he is able to enjoy the Divine even when his mind comes down
from the Absolute. Such a devotee is like the cows that give milk in
torrents.\" (All laugh.)</p>
<p>MAHIMA: \"But the milk of a cow that eats without discrimination smells
a little.\" (Laughter.)</p>
<p>MASTER (with a smile): \"That\'s true, no doubt: Therefore that milk
should be boiled. One should boil such milk over the fire a little
while; there will be no smell whatever if you boil the milk over the
fire of Knowledge. (All laugh.)</p>
<p><strong>Explanation of \"Aum\"</strong></p>
<p>(To Mahima) \"You explain \'Aum\' with reference to \'a\', \'u\', and
\'m\' only.\"</p>
<p>AHIMA: \"\'A\', \'u\', and \'m\' mean creation, preservation, and
destruction.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"But I give the illustration of the sound of a gong: \'tom\',
t-o-m. It is the merging of the Lila in the</p>
<p>Nitya: the gross, the subtle, and the causal merge in the Great Cause;
waking, dream, and deep sleep merge in Turiya. The striking of the gong
is like the falling of a heavy weight into a big ocean. Waves begin to
rise: the Relative rises from the Absolute; the causal, subtle, and
gross bodies appear out of the Great Cause; from Turiya emerge the
states of deep sleep, dream, and waking. These waves arising from the
Great Ocean merge again in the Great Ocean. From the Absolute to the
Relative, and from the Relative to the Absolute. Therefore I give the
illustration of the gong\'s sound, \'tom\'. I have clearly perceived all
these things. It has been revealed to me that there exists an Ocean of
Consciousness without limit. From It come all things of the relative
plane, and in It they merge again. Millions of Brahmandas rise in that
Chidakasa and merge in It again. All this has been revealed to me; I
don\'t know, much about what your books say.\"</p>
<p>MAHlMA: \"Those to whom such things were revealed did not write the
scriptures. They were rapt in their own experiences; when would they
write? One needs a somewhat calculating mind to write. Others learnt
these things from the seers and wrote the books.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Worldly people ask why one does not get rid of attachment to
\'woman and gold\'. That attachment disappears after the realization of
God. If a man once tastes the Bliss of Brahman, then his mind no longer
runs after the enjoyment of sense pleasures or wealth or name and fame.
If the moth once sees the light, it no longer goes into the darkness.</p>
<p>\"Some friends said to Ravana: You have been assuming different forms
for Sita . Why don\'t you go to her in</p>
<p>the form of Rāma?\' Ravana replied: \'When I contemplate Rāma, even the
position of Brahma appears insignificant to me, not to speak of the
company of another man\'s wife! How could I take the form of Rāma for
such a purpose?\'</p>
<p>\"All worship and spiritual discipline are directed to one end alone,
namely, to get rid of worldly attachment. The more you meditate on God,
the less you will be attached to the trifling things of the world. The
more you love the Lotus Feet of God, the less you will crave the things
of the world or pay heed to creature comforts. You will look on another
man\'s wife as your mother and regard your own wife as your companion in
spiritual life. You will get rid of your bestial desires and acquire
godly qualities. You will be totally unattached to the world. Though you
may still have to live in the world, you will live as a jivamnukta. The
disciples of Sri Chaitanya lived as householders in a spirit of
detachment. \"You may quote thousands of arguments from Vedānta
philosophy to a true lover of God, and try to explain the world as a
dream, but you cannot shake his devotion to God. In spite of all your
efforts he will come back to his devotion.</p>
<p>\"A man born with an element of Śiva becomes a Jnāni; his mind is always
inclined to the feeling that the world is unreal and Brahman alone is
real. But when a man is born with an element of Vishnu he. develops
ecstatic love of God. That love can never be destroyed. It may wane a
little now and then, when he indulges in philosophical reasoning, but it
ultimately returns to him increased a thousandfold.\"</p>
<p>After the devotees had left the Master, Mahimacharan brought Hazra to
the room. M. was present. Mahima said to Sri Ramakrishna: \"Sir, I have
a complaint against you. Why have you asked Hazra to go home? He has</p>
<p>no desire to return to his family.\"</p>
<p><strong>Duty to one\'s mother</strong></p>
<p>MASTER: \"His mother has told Ramlal how much she is suffering on
account of his being away from home; so I have asked Hazra to go home,
at least for three days, and see her. Can anyone succeed in spiritual
discipline if it causes suffering for, his mother? While visiting
Vrindāvan, I had almost made up my mind to live there. But, when I
remembered my mother, I said to myself, \'My mother will weep if I stay
away from her.\' So I returned here with Mathur Babu. Besides, why
should a Jnāni like Hazra be afraid of going back to the world?\"</p>
<p>MAHIMA, (with a smile): \"Sir, that would be a pertinent question if
Hazra were a Jnāni.\"</p>
<p>MASTER (smiling): \"Oh, Hazra has attained everything. He has just a
little attachment to the world because of his children and a small debt.
As people say, my aunt is now in perfect health, only she is slightly
ill!\"</p>
<p>MAHIMA: \"Where, sir, is Hazra\'s knowledge?\"</p>
<p>MASTER (smiling): \"Oh, you don\'t know! Everybody says Hazra is quite a
man.</p>
<p>Everybody knows that he lives in the Dakshineswar temple garden. People
talk of nothing but Hazra. Who would bother to mention my name?\" (All
laugh.)</p>
<p>AZRA: \"You, sir, are incomparable. You have no peer in the
world.Therefore nobody understands you.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"There you are! To be sure, no one can have dealings with the
incomparable. So why should people mention me at all?\"</p>
<p>MAHIMA: \"What does he know, sir? He will do your bidding.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"That is not so. You had better ask him about it. He said to
me, \'You and I are on even terms.\'\"</p>
<p>MAHIMA: \"He argues a great deal.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Now and then he teaches me a lesson. (All laugh.) Sometimes I
scold him when he argues too much. Later, when I am lying in bed inside
the mosquito curtain, I feel unhappy at the idea of having offended him.
So I leave the bed, go to Hazra, and salute him. Then I feel peace of
mind.</p>
<p>(To Hazra) \"Why do you address the Pure Ātman as \'Isvara\'? The Pure
Ātman is inactive and is the Witness of the three states. When I think
of the acts of creation, preservation, and destruction, then I call the
Pure Ātman \'Isvara\'. What is the Pure Ātman like? It is like a magnet
lying at a great distance from a needle. The needle moves, but the
magnet lies motionless, inactive.\"</p>
<p>Toward evening Sri Ramakrishna was pacing the room. M. was sitting
alone, thinking. Suddenly the Master said to him tenderly: \"Please give
me a couple of linen shirts. As you know, I cannot use everybody\'s
things. I thought of asking Captain for the shirts, but you had better
give them to me.\" M. felt highly gratified and said, \"As you please,
sir.\"</p>
<p>At dusk incense was burnt in Sri Ramakrishna\'s room, and, as usual, he
bowed before the pictures of gods and goddesses on the walls and chanted
their names softly. From outside one could hear the murmuring of the
Ganges and the music of the evening worship in the temples of Kāli,
Vishnu, and Śiva. Through the door one could see the priest at a
distance moving from one temple to another, a bell in his left hand and
a light in his right, an attendant carrying the gong. The evening melody
was in harmony with the spirit of the hour and place and with the
innermost thoughts of the worshippers. For the time being the sordid
things of daily life were forgotten.</p>
<p>Later Sri Ramakrishna was seated in his room in his usual blissful mood.
Ishan had come from Calcutta. He</p>
<p>had burning faith in God. He used to say, \"If a man leaves the house
with the hallowed name of Durga on his lips, then Śiva Himself protects
him with His celestial weapons.\"</p>
<p>MASTER (to Ishan): \"You have great faith. But I haven\'t so much. (All
laugh.) God can be realized only through faith.\"</p>
<p>ISHAN; \"Yes, sir.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"You practise religious rites-japa, fasting, and the like. That
is very good. If a man feels sincerely drawn to God, then God makes him
practise all these disciplines. The devotee will certainly realize God
if he practises them without desiring their results. A devotee observes
many rites because of the injunctions of the scriptures. Such devotion
is called vaidhibhakti. But there is a higher form of devotion known as
raga-bhakti, which springs from yearning and love for God. Prahlada had
such devotion. When the devotee develops that love, he no longer needs
to perform prescribed rites.</p>
<p><strong>November 9, 1884</strong></p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna was in his room, seated on the small couch and facing
the east. The devotees were sitting on the floor. It was about midday
when M. arrived and took a seat after saluting the Master. Gradually
other devotees began to gather. Vijaykrishna Goswami was there with
several Brahmo devotees. The priest Ram Chakravarty was present also.
Mahimacharan, Narayan, and Kishori arrived a few minutes later.</p>
<p>It was the beginning of winter. Sri Ramakrishna had felt the need of
some shirts and had asked M. to bring them. Besides two broad cloth
shirts, M. had brought another of a heavy material, for which Sri
Ramakrishna had not asked.</p>
<p>MASTER (to M.): \"You had better take that one back with you. You can
use it yourself. There is nothing wrong in that. Tell me, what kind of
shirt did I ask you to bring?\"</p>
<p>M: \"Sir, you told me to get you plain ones. You didn\'t ask me to buy
the heavier one.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Then please take that one back. (To Vijay and the others) You
see, Dwarika Babu gave me a shawl. The Mārwāri devotees also brought one
for me. I couldn\'t accept.\"</p>
<p>Vijay interrupted the Master, saying: \"That is right, sir. If a man
needs a thing, he must accept it. And there must be a man to give it.
Who but a man will give?\"</p>
<p><strong>God supplies the needs of devotees</strong></p>
<p>MASTER: \'The giver is the Lord Himself. The mother-in-law said to her
daughter-in-law: \'My child, I see that everybody has someone to render
him a little personal service. It would be so nice if you could find
someone to massage your feet.\' The daughter-in-law said: \'Mother, God
Himself will massage my feet. I don\'t need anyone else.\' She spoke
thus because she was a sincere lover of God.</p>
<p>\"Once a fakir went to the Emperor Akbar to ask for money. The Emperor
was saying his prayers. He prayed, \'O Lord, give me money; give me
wealth.\' The fakir started to leave the palace, but the Emperor
motioned to him to wait. After finishing his prayers, Akbar came to the
holy man and said, \'Why were you going away?\' The fakir replied, \'You
yourself were begging for money and wealth; so I thought that if I must
beg, I would beg of God and not of a beggar.\'\"</p>
<p>VIJAY: \"I saw a sādhu at Gaya. He did not take the initiative in
anything. One day he wanted to feed some devotees. Suddenly we found
that butter, flour, fruits, and other food-stuff had arrived from no one
knew where.\"</p>
<p><strong>Three classes of sādhus</strong></p>
<p>MASTER (to Vijay and the others): \'There are three classes of sādhus:
good, mediocre, and bad. The good</p>
<p>sādhu makes no effort to get his food. The dandis, among others, belong
to the mediocre and bad classes. To get food the mediocre sādhu will
knock at the door of a house and say, \'Namo Narayana\'. The bad sādhu
starts a quarrel if he doesn\'t get his alms.</p>
<p>\"The good sādhu behaves like a python. He sits in one place and the
food comes to him. The python doesn\'t move from where it is. A young
sādhu, who had been a am Brahmachari from his boyhood, went out to beg.
A young girl offered him alms. The sādhu saw her breasts and thought she
had abscesses. He asked about them. The elderly women of the family
explained that she would some day be a mother and that God had given her
breasts to give milk to her children; God had provided for all this
beforehand. At these words the sādhu was struck with wonder. He said:
Then 1 don\'t need to beg. God must have provided for me too.\"</p>
<p>Some of the devotees thought that in that case they should not take any
initiative either.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"But those who think that an effort is needed must make the
effort.\"</p>
<p>VIJAY: \'There is a nice story about that in the Bhaktamala.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Tell it to us.\"</p>
<p>VIJAY: \"Please tell us yourself.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"No, you tell it. 1 don\'t remember it very well. \"One should
hear these things at the beginning. That is why I listened to them years
ago. But now I am no longer in that mood. Hanuman said: \'I don\'t know
the position of the stars or the phase of the moon. I only think of
Rāma.\'</p>
<p>\'The chatak bird craves only rain-water. Even when it is dying of
thirst, it turns its beak upward and wants only water from the sky. The
Ganges, the Jamuna, and the seven oceans are filled to the brim, but
still it will not touch the water of the earth.</p>
<p>\'Rāma and Lakshmana visited Pampa Lake. Lakshmana saw a crow very eager
for water. Again and again it went to the edge of the water but would
not drink. Lakshmana asked Rāma about it. Rāma said: \'Brother, this
crow is a great devotee of God. Day and night it repeats the name of
Rāma. Its throat is parched with thirst, but still it won\'t drink for
fear of missing a repetition of Rāma\'s name.\'</p>
<p>\"On a full-moon night I said to Haladhāri, \'Brother, is it the night
of the new moon?\' (All laugh.)</p>
<p>(Smiling) \"Yes, it is true. Once I was told that a characteristic of a
man of Perfect Knowledge is that he cannot distinguish between the full
moon and the new moon. But how could one convince Haladhāri of that? He
said: This is certainly the dark Kaliyuga. He cannot distinguish the
full moon from the new moon! And people respect him!\"</p>
<p>Mahimacharan entered the room.</p>
<p>MASTER (respectfully): \"Come in. Come in, sir. Please take a seat.</p>
<p>(To Vijay and the other devotees) \"In the ecstatic state of mind I
cannot remember a date. The other day there was a religious festival at
Beni Pāl\'s garden. I forgot the date. I can no longer remember the last
day of the month, when it is very auspicious to repeat the name ofGod.\"</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna remained thoughtful a few minutes.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"But I remember if a man makes an engagement to visit me.</p>
<p>\"A man attains this state when his mind is one hundred per cent
absorbed in God. When Hanuman returned from Ceylon, Rāma said to him:
\'You have seen Sita . Tell me, how did you find her?\' Hanuman said:
\'O</p>
<p>Rāma, I saw that only the body of Sita lay there; it held neither her
mind nor her soul. She has indeed consecrated her mind and soul to Your
Lotus Feet. Therefore I saw only her body in Ceylon. Further, I saw the
King of Death prowling about. But what could he do? It was only a body;
it had neither mind nor soul.\'</p>
<p>\"If you meditate on an ideal you will acquire its nature. If you think
of God day and night, you will acquire the nature of God. A salt doll
went into the ocean to measure its depth. It became one with the ocean.
What is the goal of books or scriptures? The attainment of God. A man
opened a book belonging to a sādhu. He saw the word \'Rāma\' written on
every page. There was nothing else.</p>
<p>\"If a man loves God, even the slightest thing kindles spiritual feeling
in him. Then, repeating the name of Rāma but once, he gets the fruit of
ten million sandhyas. At the sight of a cloud the peacock\'s emotion is
awakened: he dances, spreading his. tail. Radha had the same experience.
Just the sight of a cloud recalled Krishna to her mind.</p>
<p>\"Chaitanyadeva was passing a village. He heard that drums were made
from the earth of that place. At once he was overwhelmed with ecstasy
because drums are used in kirtan.</p>
<p>\"But who can have this spiritual awakening? Only he who has renounced
his attachment to worldly things. If the sap of attachment is totally
dried up in a man, the slightest suggestion kindles his spiritual
emotion. Though you strike a wet match a thousand times, it will not
produce a spark. But if it is dried, the slightest rubbing will set it
aflame.</p>
<p>\"Pain and pleasure are inevitable in a body. He who has realized God
dedicates his mind and life, his body and soul, to God. When Rāma and
Lakshmana went to take their bath in Pampa Lake, they thrust their bows
into the ground. Coming out of the water, Lakshmana took out his bow and
found its tip stained with blood. Rāma said to him: \'Look, brother!
Look. Perhaps we have hurt some creature.\" Lakshmana dug in the earth
and found a big bullfrog. It was dying. Rāma said to the frog in a
sorrowful voice: \'Why didn\'t you croak? We should have tried to save
you. You croak lustily enough when you are in the jaws of a snake.\' The
frog said: \'O Lord, when I am attacked by a snake I croak, saying: \"O
Rāma, save me! O Rāma, save me!\" This time I found that it was Rāma who
was killing me; so I kept still.\'\"</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna remained silent a few moments watching the devotees. He
had heard that Mahimacharan did not believe in following a guru. He
began the conversation again.</p>
<p><strong>Faith in guru</strong></p>
<p>MASTER: \"A man should have faith in the words of his guru. He doesn\'t
have to look into his guru\'s character. \'Though my guru visits the
grog-shop, still he is the Embodiment of Eternal Bliss.\'</p>
<p>\"A man who used to give recitals of the Chandi and the Bhagavata once
said, \'A broomstick is itself unclean, but it cleans dirty places.\' \"</p>
<p>Mahimacharan studied the Vedānta. His aim was to attain Brahmajnana. He
followed the path of knowledge and was always reasoning.</p>
<p>MASTER (to Mahima): \"The aim of the Jnāni is to know the nature of his
own Self. This is Knowledge; this is</p>
<p>liberation. The true nature of the Self is that It is the Supreme
Brahman: I and the Supreme Brahman are one. But this Knowledge is hidden
on account of māyā.</p>
<p>\"I said to Harish; \'This is the whole thing: the gold is hidden under
a few basketfuls of earth, and you must remove the earth.\'</p>
<p><strong>\"I-consciousness\"</strong></p>
<p>\"The bhaktas retain \'I-consciousness\'; the jnanis do not. Nangta used
to teach how to establish oneself in the true Self, saying, \'Merge the
mind in the buddhi and the buddhi in the Ātman; then you will be
established in</p>
<p>your true Self.\"</p>
<p>\"But the \'I\' persists. It cannot be got rid of. Imagine a limitless
expanse of water: above and below, before and behind, right and left,
everywhere there is water. In that water is placed a jar filled with
water. There is water inside the jar and water outside, but the jar is
still there. The \'I\' is the jar.</p>
<p>\"Even after attaining Knowledge, the Jnāni keeps his body as before.
But the fire of Knowledge burns away his lust and other passions. Many
days ago, during an electric storm, a thunderbolt struck the Kāli
temple. We saw that no injury had been done to the doors; only the
points of the screws were broken. The doors are the body, and the
passions-lust and so forth-are the screws.</p>
<p>\"A Jnāni loves to talk only about God. He feels pained if one talks
about worldly things. But a worldly man belongs to a different class. He
always has the turban of ignorance on his head. He always comes back to
worldly topics.</p>
<p>\"The Vedas speak of the \'seven planes\' of mind. When the Jnāni\'s
mind ascends to the fifth plane, he cannot listen to anything or talk of
anything but God. At that stage only words of wisdom come from his lips.</p>
<p>\"The Vedas speak of Satchidananda Brahman. Brahman is neither one nor
two; It is between one and two. It cannot be described either as
existence or as non-existence; It is between existence and
non-existence.</p>
<p><strong>Sincere and formal devotion</strong></p>
<p>\"When the devotee develops raga-bhakti, passionate love of God, he
realizes Him. But one loses vaidhi-bhakti, formal devotion, as easily as
one gains it. This is formal devotion: so much japa, so much meditation,
so much sacrifice and homa, so many articles of worship, and the
recitation of so many mantras, before the Deity. Such devotion comes in
a moment and goes in a moment. Many people say: \'Well, friend, we have
lived on havishya for so many days! How many times we have worshipped
the Deity at our home! And what have we achieved?\' But there is no
falling away from raga-bhakti. And who gets this passionate love for
God? Those who have performed many meritorious deeds in their past
births, or those who are eternally perfect. Think of a dilapidated
house, for instance: while clearing away the undergrowth and rubbish one
suddenly discovers a fountain fitted with a pipe. It has been covered
with earth and bricks, but as soon as they are removed the water shoots
up.</p>
<p><strong>Sign of a true devotee</strong></p>
<p>\"Those who have passionate love for God do not say any such thing as:
\'O brother, how strict I have been about food! But what have I
achieved?\' New farmers give up cultivating if their fields do not yield
any crops. But hereditary farmers will continue to cultivate their
fields whether they get a crop or not. Their fathers and grandfathers
were farmers; they know that they too must accept farming as their means
of livelihood.</p>
<p>\"Only those who have developed raga-bhakti for God may be called His
sincere devotees. God becomes responsible for them. If you enter your
name in a hospital register, the doctor will not discharge you until you
are cured. Those who are held by God have nothing to fear. The son who
holds to his father, while walking along the narrow ridge of a
paddy-field, may slip if he absent-mindedly lets go his father\'s hand;
but if the father holds the son by the hand, there is no such danger.</p>
<p>\"Is there anything that is impossible for faith? And a true devotee has
faith in everything: the formless Reality, God with form, Rāma, Krishna
and the Divine Mother.</p>
<p>\"Once, while going to Kamarpukur, I was overtaken by a storm. I was in
the middle of a big meadow. The place was haunted by robbers. I began to
repeat the names of all the deities: Rāma, Krishna, and Bhagavati. I
also repeated the name of Hanuman. I chanted the names of them all. What
does that mean? Let me tell you. While the servant is counting out the
money to purchase supplies, he says, \'These pennies are for potatoes
these for egg-plants, these for fish.\' He counts the money separately,
but after the list is completed, he puts the coins together.</p>
<p>\"When one develops love of God, one likes to talk only of God. If you
love a person, you love to talk and hear about him. A worldly persn\'s
mouth waters while he talks about his son. If someone praises his son,
he will at once say to the boy, \'Go and get some water for your uncle
to wash his feet.</p>
<p>\"Those who love pigeons are highly pleased if you praise pigeons before
them. But if you speak ill of pigeons, they will at once exclaim, \'Has
anyone in your line for fourteen generations ever raised pigeons?\'\"</p>
<p><strong>Advantage of a householder\'s life</strong></p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna now addressed Mahimacharan, who was a householder.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"What need is there attachment. But you must have</p>
<p>of renouncing the world altogether? It is enough if you can rid yourself
of <em>sādhanā</em> you have to fight the sense-organs.</p>
<p>\"It is a great advantage to fight from inside a fort. You get much help
from the fort. The world is the place for enjoyment. After enjoying
different things, you should give them up one by one. Once I had a
desire to put a gold chain around my waist. I obtained one at last and
put it on, but I had to take it off immediately.</p>
<p>\"Once I ate some onion. While eating it I discriminated, \'O mind, this
is onion.\' Then I moved it to different places in my mouth and at last
spat it out.\"</p>
<p>A musician was expected. He was to sing with his party. Sri Ramakrishna
asked the devotees every now and then, \"Where is the musician?\"</p>
<p>MAHIMA: \"We are quite all right as we are.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"No, sir. You get this all through the year.\"</p>
<p>A devotee outside the room said, \"The musician has come.\"</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna was filled with joy and said, \"Ah! Has he?\"</p>
<p>Mats were spread on the floor of the long verandah northeast of the
Master\'s room. Sri Ramakrishna said:</p>
<p>\"Sprinkle a little Ganges water on the mats. Many worldly people have
sat on them.\"</p>
<p>The ladies of Pyari Babu\'s family, from Bali, had come to visit the
temples. They wanted to listen to the kirtan. A devotee said to Sri
Ramakrishna: \"These ladies have been inquiring whether there would be
any place in the room for them. Can they have seats?\" The kirtan had
already begun. The Master said, \"No, no! Where is any room here?\"</p>
<p><strong>Master and Narayan</strong></p>
<p>Narayan arrived and saluted Sri Ramakrishna. The latter said tenderly:
\"Why have you come? Your people at home have beaten you so much!\" He
signed to Baburam to give Narayan something to eat. Narayan entered the
Master\'s room. Suddenly Sri Ramakrishna followed him. He wanted to feed
Narayan with his own hands. Afterwards he returned to the verandah.</p>
<p>Many devotees were present, including Vijay, Mahimacharan, Narayan, M.,
and the younger Gopal. Soon Narayan came back to the verandah and took
his seat by the Master.</p>
<p>About three o\'clock Adhar arrived. At the sight of him Sri Ramakrishna
appeared excited. The devotee saluted the Master and sat on the floor.
Sri Ramakrishna beckoned to him to come nearer.</p>
<p>When the music was over the gathering of devotees broke up. Some began
to stroll in the garden and some went to the temples to watch the
evening service.</p>
<p>In the evening arrangements were made for kirtan inside the Master\'s
room. Sri Ramakrishna eagerly asked a devotee to have an extra lamp. The
two lamps lit the room brightly.</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna said to Vijay: \"Why are you sitting there? Come nearer
to me.\" This time the kirtan created an intense atmosphere. The Master
danced in an ecstasy of joy; the devotees also danced encircling him.
While Vijay was dancing his cloth dropped. He was unconscious.</p>
<p>When the music was over, Vijay began to look for his key, which had
fallen somewhere. The Master said to him with a laugh, \"Why bother
about it any more?\"</p>
<p>He meant that Vijay should have nothing more to do with boxes and keys.</p>
<p>Kishori saluted Sri Ramakrishna and was about to take his leave. The
Master blessed him, touching his chest tenderly, and bade him good-bye.
His words were full of love. M. and Gopal saluted the Master. They too
were about to take their leave. He said to them with the same affection:
\"Couldn\'t you go tomorrow morning? You may catch cold at night.\"</p>
<p>M. and Gopal decided to spend the night with Sri Ramakrishna. They sat
on the floor with a few other devotees.</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna had had no rest the whole day: the devotees had been
with him all the time. He went out for a few minutes. Returning to the
room he saw M. taking down a song from Ramlal.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"What are you doing?\"</p>
<p>M. said that he was writing down a song. On being told what the song
was, the Master remarked that it was a rather long song. M. wrote a line
or two and then stopped writing.</p>
<p>A little later Sri Ramakrishna took his supper of farina pudding and one
or two luchis. A lighted lamp stood on a stand by his side. M. sat near
him. The Master asked if there were any sweets in the room. M. had
brought some sandesh which he had put on the shelf. Sri Ramakrishna
asked M. to give him a sweet. M. searched for the sweets but could not
find them. He was embarrassed. They had been given to the devotees.</p>
<p>After finishing his supper, Sri Ramakrishna sat on the small couch and
M. seated himself on the foot-rug. The Master, talking about Narayan,
was overcome with emotion.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"I saw Naran today.\"</p>
<p>M: \"Yes, sir. His eyes were moist. When I looked at his face I felt
like weeping.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \'The sight of him arouses a mother\'s love in me, as it were.
His relatives beat him at home because he comes here. There is none to
defend him.\"M : \'The other day he left his books at Haripada\'s house
and fled to you.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"It was not good for him to do that.\"</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna was silent. After a few minutes he continued.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"You see, he has much substance in him. Otherwise, how could I
be attracted to him even though I was listening to the kirtan at the
time? I had to leave the music and go into the room. That never happened
before.\"</p>
<p>Again Sri Ramakrishna fell silent. A few minutes later he began to talk.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"In an ecstatic state I asked him how he was feeling. He just
said he was happy. (To M.) Feed him</p>
<p>now and then-as parents do their child.\"</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna then spoke about Tejchandra.</p>
<p>MASTER (to M.): \"Please ask him what he thinks of me. Does he thinkof
me as a Jnāni? Or what does he say about me? I understand that he is
very reticent. (To Gopal) Ask Tejchandra to come here Saturdays and
Tuesdays. (To M.) Suppose I go to your school and look for-\"</p>
<p>M. thought that Sri Ramakrishna wanted to go to his school to see
Narayan. He said to the Master, \"You might as well wait at our house.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"No, I have something else in mind. I should like to see
whetherthere are other worth-while boys in the school.\"</p>
<p>M: \"Of course you can go. Other visitors come to the school. You
cancome too.\"</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna was smoking. M. and Gopal finished their supper. They
decided to sleep in the nahabat. M.</p>
<p>again sat on the floor near Sri Ramakrishna.</p>
<p>MASTER (to M.): \'There may be some pots and pans in the nahabat.Why not
sleep here in this room?\"</p>
<p>M: \"Very well, sir.\"</p>
<p>It was ten or eleven o\'clock at night. Sri Ramakrishna was sitting on
the small couch, resting against a pillow. M. sat on the floor. The
Master was conversing with him. A lamp burnt on a stand near the wall.
The Master felt great compassion for his devotees. He wanted to bless M.
by accepting his personal service.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"My feet ache. Please rub them gently.\"</p>
<p>M. seated himself on the small couch and took the Master\'s feet on his
lap. He stroked them. Now and then Sri Ramakrishna would ask his
disciple a question.</p>
<p>MASTER (smiling): \"How did you like today\'s conversation?\"</p>
<p>M: \"Very much indeed.\"</p>
<p>MASTER (smiling): \"How I spoke about the Emperor Akbar!\"</p>
<ol>
<li>\"It was very good.\" MASTER: \"Repeat it to me.\"</li>
</ol>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
1.  \"A fakir came to visit Akbar. The Emperor was saying his prayers.
    In his prayers he was asking God to give him wealth and riches.
    Thereupon the fakir was about to leave the. room quietly. Later,
    when the Emperor asked him about it, the fakir said, \'If I must
    beg, why should I beg of a beggar?\'\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"What else did we talk about?\"</p>
<ol>
<li>\"You told us a great deal about saving up for the future.\" MASTER
    (smiling): \"What did I say?\"</li>
</ol>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
1.  \"As long as a man feels that he must try, he should make an effort.
    How well you told us about it at Sinthi!\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"What did I say?\"</p>
<ol>
<li>\"God takes upon Himself complete responsibility for one who totally
    &gt; depends upon Him. It is like a guardian taking charge of a minor.
    &gt; You also told us that at a feast a child cannot by himself find a
    &gt; place to eat his meal; someone finds a place for him.\"</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>MASTER: \"No, that is not quite to the point. I said that the child
doesn\'t fall if the father leads him and holds his hand.\"</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>\"You also described the three classes of sādhus. The best sādhu
    &gt; does not move about to get his food; he lives in one place and
    &gt; gets his food there, You told us about that young sādhu who said,
    &gt; when he saw the breasts of a young girl, \'Why has she those
    &gt; abscesses?\' You told us many other things.\"</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>MASTER (smiling): \"What else?\"</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>\"About the crow of Pampa Lake. He repeated the name of Rāma day and
    &gt; night. That is why he couldn\'t drink the water though he went to
    &gt; its edge. And about the holy man in whose book was written only
    &gt; \'Om Rāma\'. And what Hanuman said to Rāma.\"</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>MASTER: \"What did he say?\"</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>\"Hanuman said to Rāma: \'I saw Sita in Ceylon; but it was only her
    &gt; body. Her mind and soul were lying at Your feet.\'</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>\"And about the chatak bird. He will not drink anything but
rain-water. And about jnanayoga and bhaktiyoga.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"What did I say about them?\"</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>\"As long as one is conscious of the \'jar\', the ego will certainly
    &gt; remain. As long as one is conscious of \'I\', one cannot get rid
    &gt; of the idea, \'I am the devotee and Thou art God\'.\"</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>MASTER: \"No, it is not that; the \'jar\' doesn\'t disappear whether
one is conscious of it or not. One cannot get rid of the \'I\'. You
may reason a thousand times; still it will not go.\"</p>
<p>M. remained silent a few moments.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>\"You had that talk with Ishan Mukherji in the Kāli temple. We were
    &gt; very lucky to be there.\" MASTER (smiling): \"Yes, yes. Tell me,
    &gt; what did I say?\"</li>
</ol>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
1.  \"You said that work is only the first step. You told us that you
    said to Sambhu Mallick, \'If God appears before you, will you ask
    Him for a number of hospitals and dispensaries?\'</p>
<blockquote>
<p>\"You said another thing: God does not reveal Himself to a person as
long as he is attached to work. You said that to Keshab Sen.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"What did I say?\"</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>\"As long as the baby plays with the toy and forgets everything
    else, its mother looks after her cooking and other household duties;
    but when the baby throws away the toy and cries, then the mother
    puts down the rice-pot and comes to the baby.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>\"You said another thing that day: Lakshmana asked Rāma where one
could find God; after a great deal of explanation, Rāma said to him,
\'Brother, I dwell in the man in whom you find ecstatic love-a love
which makes him laugh and weep and dance and sing.\' \"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Ah me! Ah me!\"</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna sat in silence a few minutes.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>\"That day you spoke only words of renunciation to Ishan. Since then
    many of us have come to our senses. Now we are eager to reduce our
    duties. You said that day, \'Ravana died in Ceylon and Behula wept
    bitterly for him.\'\"</li>
</ol>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna laughed aloud.</p>
<p>M. (humbly): \"Sir, isn\'t it desirable to reduce the number of one\'s
duties and entanglements?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Yes. But it is a different thing if you happen to come across
a sādhu or a poor man. Then you should serve him.\"</p>
<ol>
<li>\"And. that day you spoke very rightly to Ishan about flatterers.
    They are like vultures on a carcass. You once said that to
    Padmalochan also.\"</li>
</ol>
<p>MASTER: \"No, to Vamandas of Ulo.\"</p>
<p>After a while M. sat on the floor near the small couch. Sri Ramakrishna
felt sleepy; he said to M.: \"Go to sleep. Where is Gopal? Please shut
the door.\"</p>
<p>Next morning Sri Ramakrishna left his bed very early. As usual, he
chanted the holy names of the different gods and goddesses. Now and then
he looked at the sacred river. The morning worship began in the temples
of Radhakanta and Mother Kāli. M. had spent the night on the floor of
the Master\'s room. He left his bed and watched the worship in. the
different temples.</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna finished his bath and went with M. to the Kāli temple.
He asked the disciple to lock the door of his room.</p>
<p>In the temple he took the seat in front of the image of Kāli and offered
flowers, sometimes at Her feet and sometimes on his own head. He fanned
the Deity. Then he returned to his room and asked M. to unlock the door.
Entering the room, he sat on the small couch. He was completely
overwhelmed with divine fervour and began to chant the name of God. M.
sat alone on the floor. Sri Ramakrishna began to sing about the Divine
Mother:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Who is there that can understand what Mother Kāli is?</em></p>
<p><em>Even the six darsanas are powerless to reveal Her.</em></p>
<p><em>It is She, the scriptures say, that is the Inner Self</em></p>
<p><em>Of the yogi, who in Self discovers all his joy;</em></p>
<p><em>She that, of Her own sweet will, inhabits every living thing. .</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then he sang:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>All creation is the sport of my mad Mother Kāli;</em></p>
<p><em>By Her māyā the three worlds are bewitched. . . .</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He continued:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>O Kāli, who can know Thee? Numberless are Thy forms. . .</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again he sang:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>O Mother, redeem me speedily!</em></p>
<p><em>From terror of the King of Death I am about to die.</em></p>
<p><em>M. said to himself, \"I wish he would sing:</em></p>
<p><em>Mother, Thou canst not trick me any more,</em></p>
<p><em>For I have seen Thy crimson Lotus Feet.\"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Strangely enough, no sooner had the thought passed through M.\'s mind
than Sri Ramakrishna sang the song. A few minutes later he said to M.,
\"What do you think of the present state of my mind?\"</p>
<p>M. (smiling): \"It is your simple and natural state.\"</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna sang to himself the following refrain of a song:</p>
<p><em>Unless a man is simple, he cannot recognize God, the Simple One.</em></p>
<blockquote>
