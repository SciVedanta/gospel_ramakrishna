<p>M. AT DAKSHINESWAR (I)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tuesday, December 18, 1883</p>
</blockquote>
<p>SRI RAMAKRISHNA was seated in his room with his devotees. He spoke
highly of Devendranath Tagore\'s love of God and renunciation, and then
said, pointing to Rākhāl and the other young devotees, \"Devendra is a
good man; but blessed indeed are those young aspirants who, like
Sukadeva, practise renunciation from their very boyhood and think of God
day and night without being involved in worldly life.</p>
<p><strong>Nature of worldly people</strong></p>
<p>\"The worldly man always has some desire or other, though at times he
shows much devotion to God. Once Mathur Babu was entangled in a lawsuit.
He said to me in the shrine of Kāli, \'Sir, please offer this flower to
the Divine Mother.\' I offered it unsuspectingly, but he firmly believed
that he would attain his objective if I offered the flower.</p>
<p>\"What devotion Rati\'s mother had! How often she used to come here and
how much she served me! She was a Vaishnava. One day she noticed that I
ate the food offered at the Kāli temple, and that stopped her coming.
Her devotion to God was one-sided. It isn\'t possible to understand a
person right away.\"</p>
<p>It was a winter morning, and the Master was sitting near the east door
of his room, wrapped in his moleskin shawl. He looked at the sun and
suddenly went into samādhi. His eyes stopped blinking and he lost all
consciousness of the outer world. After a long time he came down to the
plane of the sense world. Rākhāl , Hazra, M., and other devotees were
seated near him.</p>
<p>MASTER (to Hazra): \"The state of samādhi is certainly inspired by love.
Once, at Syambazar, they arranged a kirtan at Natavar Goswami\'s house.
There I had a vision of Krishna and the gopis of Vrindāvan. I felt that
my subtle body was walking at Krishna\'s heels.</p>
<p>\"I went into samādhi when similar devotional songs were sung at the
Hari Sabha in Jorashanko in Calcutta. That day they feared I might give
up the body.\"</p>
<p>After the Master had finished his bath, he again spoke of the ecstatic
love of the gopis. He said to M. and the other devotees: \"One should
accept the fervent attachment of the gopis to their beloved Krishna.
Sing songs like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Tell me, friend, how far is the grove</em></p>
<p><em>Where Krishna, my Beloved, dwells?</em></p>
<p><em>His fragrance reaches me even here;</em></p>
<p><em>But I am tired and can walk no farther.\"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again he sang:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I am not going home, O friend,</em></p>
<p><em>For there it is hard for me to chant my Krishna\'s name. . . .</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna had vowed to offer green coconut and sugar to
Siddhesvari, the Divine Mother, for Rākhāl \'s welfare. He asked M.
whether he would pay for the offerings.</p>
<p>That afternoon the Master, accompanied by M., Rākhāl , and some other
devotees, set out in a carriage for the temple of Siddhesvari in
Calcutta. On the way the offerings were purchased. On reaching the
temple, the Master asked the devotees to offer the fruit and sugar to
the Divine Mother. They saw the priests and their friends playing cards
in the temple. Sri Ramakrishna said: \"To play cards in a temple! One
should think of God here.\"</p>
<p>From the temple the Master went to Jadu Mallick\'s house. Jadu was
surrounded by his admirers, well-dressed dandies. He welcomed the
Master.</p>
<p>MASTER ((with a smile): \"Why do you keep so many clowns and flatterers
with you?\"</p>
<p>JADU (smiling): \"That you may liberate them.\" (Laughter.)</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Flatterers think that the rich man will loosen his
purse-strings for them. But it is very difficult to get anything from
him. Once a jackal saw a bullock and would not give up his company. The
bullock roamed about and the jackal followed him. The jackal thought:
\'There hang the bullock\'s testicles. Some time or other they will drop
to the ground and I shall eat them.\' When the bullock slept on the
ground, the jackal lay down too, and when the bullock moved about, the
jackal followed him. Many days passed in this way, but the bullock\'s
testicles still clung to his body. The jackal went away disappointed.
(All laugh.) That also happens to flatterers.\"</p>
<p>Jadu and his mother served refreshments to Sri Ramakrishna and the
devotees.</p>
<p><strong>Wednesday, December 19, 1883</strong></p>
<p>It was nine o\'clock in the morning. Sri Ramakrishna was talking to M.
near the bel-tree at Dakshineswar. This tree, under which the Master had
practised the most austere sadhana, stood in the northern end of the
temple garden. Farther north ran a high wall, and just outside was the
government magazine. West of the bel-tree was a row of tall pines that
rustled in the wind. Below the trees flowed the Ganges, and to the south
could be seen the sacred grove of the Panchavati. The dense trees and
underbrush hid the temples. No noise of the outside world reached the
bel-tree.</p>
<p>MASTER (to M.): \"But one cannot realize God without renouncing \'woman
and gold\'.\"</p>
<p>M: \"Why? Did not Vasishtha say to Rāma, \'O Rāma, You may renounce the
world if the world is outside God\'?\"</p>
<p>MASTER (smiling): \"He said that to Rāma so that Rāma might destroy
Ravana. Rāma accepted the life of a householder and married to fulfil
that mission.\"</p>
<p>M. stood there like a log, stunned and speechless.</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna went to the Panchavati on his way back to his room. M.
accompanied him. It was then about ten o\'clock.</p>
<p><strong>Path of the Impersonal God</strong></p>
<p>M: \"Sir, is there no spiritual discipline leading to realization of the
Impersonal God?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Yes, there is. But the path is extremely difficult. After
intense austerities the rishis of olden times realized God as their
inner most consciousness and experienced the real nature of Brahman. But
how hard they had to work! They went out of their dwellings in the early
morning and all day practised austerities and meditation. Returning home
at nightfall, they took a light supper of fruit and roots.</p>
<p>\"But an aspirant cannot succeed in this form of spiritual discipline if
his mind is stained with worldliness even in the slightest degree. The
mind must withdraw totally from all objects of form, taste, smell,
touch, and sound. Only thus does it become pure. The Pure Mind is the
same as the Pure Ātman. But such a mind must be altogether free from
\'woman and gold\'. When it becomes pure, one has another experience.
One realizes: \'God alone is the Doer, and I am His instrument.\' One
does not feel oneself to be absolutely necessary to others either in
their misery or in their happiness.</p>
<p>\"Once a wicked man beat into unconsciousness a monk who lived in a
monastery. On regaining consciousness he was asked by his friends, \'Who
is feeding you milk?\' The monk said, \'He who beat me is now feeding
me.\' \"</p>
<p>M: \"Yes, sir. I know that story.\"</p>
<p><strong>Obstacles to samādhi</strong></p>
<p>MASTER: \"It is not enough to know it. One must assimilate its meaning.
It is the thought of worldly objects that prevents the mind from going
into samādhi. One becomes established in samādhi when one is completely
rid of worldliness. It is possible for me to give up the body in
samādhi; but I have a slight desire to enjoy the love of God and the
company of His devotees. Therefore I pay a little attention to my body.</p>
<p>\"There is another kind of samādhi, called unmana samādhi. One attains
it by suddenly gathering the dispersed mind. You understand what that
is, don\'t you?\"</p>
<p>M: \"Yes, sir.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Yes. It is the sudden withdrawal of the dispersed mind to the
Ideal. But that samādhi does not last long. Worldly thoughts intrude and
destroy it. The yogi slips down from his yoga.</p>
<p>\"At Kamarpukur I have seen the mongoose living in its hole up in the
wall. It feels snug there. Sometimes people tie a brick to its tail;
then the pull of the brick makes it come out of its hole. Every time the
mongoose tries to be comfortable inside the hole, it has to come out
because of the pull of the brick. Such is the effect of brooding on
worldly objects that it makes the yogi stray from the path of yoga.</p>
<p>\"Worldly people may now and then experience samādhi.</p>
<p>its petals close again when the sun is covered by a cloud.</p>
<p>The lotus blooms, no doubt, when the sun is up; but Worldly thought is
the cloud.\"</p>
<p>M: \"Isn\'t it possible to develop both jnāna and bhakti by the practice
of spiritual discipline?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Through the path of bhakti a man may attain them both. If it
is necessary, God gives him the Knowledge of Brahman. But a highly
qualified aspirant may develop both jnāna and bhakti at the same time.
Such is the case with the Isvarakotis-Chaitanya for example. But the
case of ordinary devotees is different.</p>
<p>\"There are five kinds of light: the light of a lamp, the light of
various kinds of fire, the light of the moon, the light of the sun, and
lastly the combined light of the sun and the moon. Bhakti is the light
of the moon, and jnāna the light of the sun.</p>
<p>\"Sometimes it is seen that the sun has hardly set when the moon rises
in the sky. In an Incarnation of God one sees, at the same time, the sun
of Knowledge and the moon of Love.</p>
<p>\"Can everyone, by the mere wish, develop Knowledge and Love at the same
time? It depends on the person. One bamboo is more hollow than another.
Is it possible for all to comprehend the nature of God? Can a one seer
pot hold five seers of milk?\"</p>
<p>M: \"But what about the grace of God? Through His grace a camel can pass
through the eye of a needle.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"But is it possible to obtain God\'s grace just like that? A
beggar may get a penny, if he asks for it.</p>
<p>But suppose he asks you right off for his train fare: How about that?\"</p>
<p>M. stood silent. The Master, too, remained silent. Suddenly he said:
\"Yes, it is true. Through the grace of God some may get both jnāna and
bhakti.\"</p>
<p>M. saluted the Master and went back to the bel-tree.</p>
<p>At midday, finding that M. had not yet returned, Sri Ramakrishna started
toward the bel-tree; but on reaching the Panchavati he met M. carrying
his prayer carpet and water-jug. M. saluted the Master.</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna said to M: \"I was coming to look for you. Because of
your delay I thought you might have</p>
<p>scaled the wall and run away. I watched your eyes this morning and felt
apprehensive lest you should go away like Narayan Shastri. Then I said
to myself: \'No, he won\'t run away. He thinks a great deal before doing
anything.\' \"</p>
<p>The same night the Master talked to M., Rākhāl , Lātu, Harish, and a few
other devotees.</p>
<p>MASTER (to M.): \"Some people give a metaphysical interpretation of the
Vrindāvan episode of Sri Krishna\'s life. What do you say about it?\"</p>
<ol>
<li>\"There are various opinions. What if there are? You have told us
    the story of Bhishmadeva\'s weeping, on his bed of arrows, because
    he could not understand anything of God\'s ways.</li>
</ol>
<p>\"Again, you have told us that Hanuman used to say: \'I don\'t know any
thing about the day of the week, the position of the stars, and so
forth. I only meditate on Rāma.\'</p>
<p>\"Further, you have said to us that in the last analysis there are two
things only. Brahman and Its Power. You have also said that, after the
attainment of Brahmajnana, a man realizes these two to be One, the One
that has no two\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Yes, that is true. Your ideal is to reach the goal. You may
reach it by going either through a thorny forest or along a good road.</p>
<p>\"Diverse opinions certainly exist. Nangta used to say that the monks
could not be feasted because of the diversity of their views. Once a
feast was arranged for the sannyasis. Monks belonging to many sects were
invited. Everyone claimed that his sect should be fed first, but no
conclusion could be arrived at. At last they all went away and the food
had to be given to the prostitutes.\"</p>
<p>M: \"Totapuri was indeed a great soul.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"But Hazra says he was an ordinary man. There\'s no use in
discussing these things. Everyone says that his watch alone gives the
correct time.</p>
<p>\"You see, Narayan Shastri developed a spirit of intense renunciation.
He was a great scholar. He gave up his wife and went away. A man attains
yoga when he completely effaces \'woman and gold\' from his mind. With
some, the characteristics of the yogi are well marked.</p>
<p>\"I shall have to tell you something of the six centres. The mind of the
yogi passes through these, and he realizes God through His grace. Have
you heard of the six centres?\"</p>
<p>M: \"These are the \'seven planes\' of the Vedānta.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Not the Vedānta, but the Vedas. Do you know what the six
centres are like? They are the \'lotuses\' in the subtle body. The yogis
see them. They are like the fruits and leaves of a wax tree.\"</p>
<ol>
<li>\"Yes, sir. The yogis can perceive them. I have read that there is a
    kind of glass through which a tiny object looks very big. Likewise,
    through yoga one can see those subtle lotuses.\"</li>
</ol>
<p>Following Sri Ramakrishna\'s direction, M. spent the night in the hut at
the Panchavati. In the early hours of the morning he was singing alone:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I am without the least benefit of prayer and austerity, O Lord!</em></p>
<p><em>I am the lowliest of the lowly; make me pure with Thy hallowed
touch.</em></p>
<p><em>One by one I pass my days in hope of reaching Thy Lotus Feet,</em></p>
<p><em>But Thee, alas, I have not found. . . .</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Suddenly M. glanced toward the window and saw the Master standing there.
Sri Ramakrishna\'s eyes became heavy with tears as M. sang the line:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I am the lowliest of the lowly; make me pure with Thy hallowed
touch.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>M. sang again:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>shall put on the ochre robe and ear-rings made of conch-shell;
    &gt; Thus, in the garb of a yogini, from place to place I shall wander,
    &gt; Till I have found my cruel Hari. . . .</em></li>
</ol>

1.  saw that the Master was walking with Rākhāl .</p>
<p><strong>Friday, December 21, 1883</strong></p>
<p>In the morning the Master and M. were conversing alone under the
bel-tree. The Master told him many secrets of spiritual discipline,
exhorting him to renounce \"woman and gold\". He further said that the
mind at times becomes one\'s guru.</p>
<p>After his midday meal the Master went to the Panchavati wearing a
beautiful yellow robe. Two or three Vaishnava monks were there, clad in
the dress of their sect.</p>
<p>In the afternoon a monk belonging to the sect of Nanak arrived. He was a
worshipper of the formless God. Sri Ramakrishna asked him to meditate as
well on God with form. The Master said to him: \"Dive deep; one does not
get the precious gems by merely floating on the surface. God is without
form, no doubt; but He also has form. By meditating on God with form one
speedily acquires devotion; then one can meditate on the formless God.
It is like throwing a letter away, after learning its contents, and then
setting out to follow its instructions.\"</p>
<p><strong>Saturday, December 22, 1883</strong></p>
<p>Rākhāl , Harish, M., and Lātu had been staying with Sri Ramakrishna at
Dakshineswar. About nine o\'clock in the morning the Master was sitting
with them on the southeast verandah of his room, when Balarām\'s father
and Devendra Ghosh of Syampukur arrived.</p>
<p>A DEVOTEE: \"Sir, how does one obtain love for God?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Go forward. The king dwells beyond the seven gates. You can
see him only after passing through all the gates.</p>
<p>\"At the time of the installation of Annapurna at Chanak, I said to
Dwarika Babu: \'Large fish live in the deep water of a big lake. Throw
some spiced bait into the water; then the fish will come, attracted by
its smell; now and then they will make the water splash. Devotion and
ecstatic love are like the spiced bait.</p>
<p><strong>Divine Incarnations</strong></p>
<p>\"God sports in the world as man. He incarnates Himself as man-as in the
case of Krishna, Rāma, and Chaitanya. Once I said to Keshab: \'The
greatest manifestation of God is in man. There are small holes in the
balk of a field, where crabs and fish accumulate in the rainy season. If
you want to find them you must seek them in the holes. If you seek God,
you must seek Him in the Incarnations.\'</p>
<p>\"The Divine Mother of the Universe manifests Herself through this
three-and-a-half cubit man. There is a song that says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>O Mother, what a machine is this that Thou hast made!</em></p>
<p><em>What pranks Thou playest with this toy</em></p>
<p><em>Three and a half cubits high!</em></p>
<p>\"One needs spiritual practice in order to know God and recognize
Divine Incarnations. Big fish live in</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the large lake, but to see them one must throw spiced bait in the water.
There is butter in milk, but one must churn the milk to get it. There is
oil in mustard-seed, but one must press the seed to extract the oil.\"</p>
<p>DEVOTEE: \"Has God form, or is He formless?\"</p>
<p>MASTER:\"Wait, wait! First of all you must go to Calcutta; then only
will you know where the Maidan, the Asiatic Society, and the Bengal Bank
are located. If you want to go to the brahmin quarter of Khardaha, you
must first of all go to Khardaha.</p>
<p>\"Why should it not be possible to practice the discipline of the
formless God? But it is very difficult to follow that path. One cannot
follow it without renouncing \'woman and gold\'. There must be complete
renunciation, both inner and outer. You cannot succeed in this path if
you have the slightest trace of worldliness.</p>
<p>\"It is easy to worship God with form. But it is not easy as all that.</p>
<p>\"One should not discuss the discipline of the Impersonal God or Through
great effort perhaps he is just cultivating a little devotion.
everything as a mere dream.</p>
<p>the path of knowledge with a bhakta. You will injure it if you explain
away</p>
<p>\"Kabir was a worshipper of the Impersonal God. He did not believe in
Śiva, Kāli, or Krishna. He used to make fun of them and say that Kāli
lived on the offerings of rice and banana, and that Krishna danced like
a monkey when the gopis clapped their hands. (<em>All laugh</em>).</p>
<p>\"One who worships God without form perhaps sees at first the deity with
ten arms, then the deity with four arms, then the Baby Krishna with two
arms. At last he sees the Indivissible Light and merges in It.</p>
<p>\"It is said that sages like Dattatreya and Jadabharata did not return
to the relative plane after having the visition of Brahman. According to
some people Sukadeva tasted only a drop of that Ocean of
Brahman-Consciousness. He saw and heard the rumbling of the waves of
that Ocean, but did not dive into It.</p>
<p>\"A brahmachari once said to me, \'One who goes beyond Kedār cannot keep
his body alive.\' Likewise, a man cannot preserve his body after
attaining Brahmajnana.1 The body drops off in twenty-one days.</p>
<p>\"There was an infinite field beyond a high wall. Four friends tried to
find out what was beyond the wall. Three of them, one after the other,
climbed the wall, saw the field, burst into loud laughter, and dropped
to the other side. These three could not give any information about the
field. Only the fourth man came back and told people about it. He is
like those who retain their bodies, even after attaining Brahmajnana, in
order to teach others. Divine Incarnations belong to this class.</p>
<p>\"Parvati was born as the daughter of King Himalaya. After Her birth She
revealed to the king Her various divine forms. The father said: \'Well,
Daughter, You have shown me all these forms. That is nice. But You have
another aspect, which is Brahman. Please show me that.\' \'Father,\'
replied Parvati, \'if you seek the Knowledge of Brahman, then renounce
the world and live in the company of holy men.\' But King Himalaya
insisted. Thereupon Parvati revealed Her Brahman-form, and immediately
the king fell down unconscious.</p>
<p>\"All that I have just said belongs to the realm of reasoning. Brahman
alone is real and the world illusory-that is reasoning. And everything
but Brahman is like a dream. But this is an extremely difficult path. To
one who follows it even the divine play in the world becomes like a
dream and appears unreal; his \'I\' also vanishes. The followers of this
path do not accept the Divine Incarnation. It is a very difficult path.
The lovers of God should not hear much of such reasoning.</p>
<p>\"That is why God incarnates Himself as man and teaches people the path
of devotion. He exhorts people to cultivate self-surrender to God.
Following the path of devotion, one realizes everything through His
grace both Knowledge and Supreme Wisdom.</p>
<p>\"God sports in this world. He is under the control of His devotee.
\'Syama, the Divine Mother, is Herself tied by the cord of the love of
Her devotee.\'</p>
<p>\"Sometimes God becomes the magnet and the devotee the needle, and
sometimes the devotee becomes the magnet and God the needle. The devotee
attracts God to him. God is the Beloved of His devotee and is under his
control.</p>
<p>\"According to one school, the gopis of Vrindāvan, like Yaśoda, had
believed in the formless God in their previous births; but they did not
derive any satisfaction from this belief. That is why later on they
enjoyed so much bliss in the company of Sri Krishna in the Vrindāvan
episode of His life. One day Krishna said to the gopis: \'Come along. I
shall show you the Abode of the Eternal. Let us go to the Jamuna for a
bath.\' As they dived into the water of the river, they at once saw
Goloka. Next they saw the Indivisible Light. Thereupon Yaśoda exclaimed:
\'O Krishna, we don\'t care for these things any more. We would like to
see You in Your human form. I want to take You in my arms and feed
You.\'</p>
<p><strong>God and His devotee</strong></p>
<p>\"So the greatest manifestation of God is through His Incarnations. The
devotee should worship and serve an Incarnation of God as long as He
lives in a human body. \'At the break of day He disappears into the
secret chamber of His House.\'</p>
<p><strong>God manifesting Himself as living beings</strong></p>
<p>\"Not all, by any means, can recognize an Incarnation of God. Assuming a
human body, the Incarnation falls victim to disease, grief, hunger,
thirst, and all such things, like ordinary mortals. Rāma wept for Sita.
\'Brahman weeps, entrapped in the snare of the five elements.\'</p>
<p>\"It is said in the Purana that God, in His Incarnation as the Sow,
lived happily with His young ones even after the destruction of
Hiranyāksha. As the Sow, He nursed them and forgot all about His abode
in heaven. At last Śiva killed the sow body with his trident, and God,
laughing aloud, went to His own abode.\"</p>
<p>In the afternoon Bhavanath arrived. Rākhāl , M., Harish, and other
devotees were in the room.</p>
<p>MASTER (<em>to Bhavanath</em>): \"To love an Incarnation of God- that is
enough. Ah, what ecstatic love the gopis had for Krishna!\"</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna began to sing, asuming the attitude of the gopis:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>O Krishna! You are the Soul of my soul...</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then he sang:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I am not going home, O friend,</em></p>
<p><em>For there it is hard for me to chant my Krishna\'s name</em>...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>O Friend, that day I stood at my door as You were going to the
woods...</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Continuing, the Master said:\"When Krishna suddenly disappeared in the
act of dancing and playing with gopis, they were beside themselves with
grief. Looking at tree, they said: \'O tree, you must be a great hermit.
You must have seen Krishna. Otherwise, why do you stand there
motionless, as if absorbed in samādhi?\' Looking at the earth covered
with green grass, they said\" \'O earth, you must have seen Kirshna.
Otherwise, why does your hair stand on end? you must have enjoyed the
thrill of His touch.\' Looking at the madhavi creeper, they said, \'O
madhavi, give us back our Madhava!\' The gopis were intoxicated with
ecstatic love for Krishna. Akrura came to Vrindāvan to take Krishna and
Balarama to Mathura. When they mounted the chariot, the gopis clung to
the wheels. They would not let the chariot move.\"</p>
<p>Saying this, Sri Ramkrisna sang, assuming the attitude of Akrura:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Hold not, hold not the chariot\'s wheels!</em></p>
<p><em>Is it the wheels that make it move?</em></p>
<p><em>The Mover of its wheels is Krishna,</em></p>
<p><em>By whose will the worlds are moved....</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>MASTER: \" <em>\'Is it the wheels that make it move?\' \'By whose will the
worlds are moved.\'</em> \'The driver moves the</p>
<p>chariot at His Master\'s bidding.\' I feel deeply touched by these
lines.\"</p>
<p><strong>Sunday, December 23, 1883</strong></p>
<p>At nine o\'clock in the morning Sri Ramakrishna was seated on the
southwest porch of his room, with Rākhāl , Lātu, M., Harish, and some
other devotees. M. had now been nine days with the Master at
Dakshineswar. Earlier in the morning Manomohan had arrived from Konnagar
on this way to Calcutta. Hazra, too, was present.</p>
<p>A Vaishnava was singging. Referring to one of the songs, Sri Ramakrishna
said: \"I didn\'t enjoy that song very much. The songs of the earlier
writers seem to me to have more of the right spirit. Once I sang for
Nangta</p>
<p>at the Panchavati: <em>\'To arms! To arms, O man! Death storms your house
in battle array.\'</em> I sang another: <em>\'O</em></p>
<p><em>Mother, I have no one else to blame: Alas! I sink in the well these
very hands have dug.\'</em></p>
<p>\"Nangta, the Vedantist, was a man of profound knowledge. understand its
meaning. Padmalochan also wept when I Mother. And he was truly a great
pundit.\"</p>
<p>The song moved him to tears though he didn\'t sang the songs of
Ramprasad about the Divine</p>
<p>After the midday meal Sri Ramakrishna rested a few minutes in his room.
M. was sitting on the floor. The Master was delighted to hear the music
that was being played in the nahabat. He then explained to M. that
Brahman alone has become the universe and all living beings.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Referring to a certain place, someone once said to me:
\'Nobody sings the name of God there. It has no holy atmosphere.\' No
sooner did he say this than I perceived that it was God alone who had
become all living beings. They appeared as countless bubbles, or
reflections in the Ocean of Satchidananda.</p>
<p>\"Again, I find sometimes that living beings are like so many pills made
of Indivisible Consciousness. Once I was on my way to Burdwan from
Kamarpukur. At one place I ran to the meadow to see how living beings
are sustained. I saw ants crawling there. It appeared to me that every
place was filled with Consciousness.\"</p>
<p>Hazra entered the room and sat on the floor.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Again, I perceive that living beings are like different
flowers with various layers of petals. They are also revealed to me as
bubbles, some big, some small.\"</p>
<p><strong>Master\'s childlike mood</strong></p>
<p>While describing in this way the vision of different divine forms, the
Master went into an ecstatic state and said, \"I have become! I am
here!\" Uttering these words he went into samādhi. His body was
motionless. He remained in that state a long time and then gradually
regained partial consciousness of the world. He began to laugh like a
boy and pace the room. His eyes radiated bliss as if he had seen a
wondrous vision. His gaze was not fixed on any particular object, and
his face beamed with joy. Still pacing the room, the Master said: \"I
saw the paramahamsa who stayed under the banyan tree walking thus with
just such a smile. Am I too in that state of mind?\"</p>
<p>He sat on the small couch and engaged in conversation with the Divine
Mother.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"I don\'t even care to know. Mother, may I have pure love for
Thy Lotus Feet!</p>
<p>(To M.) \"One attains this state immediately after freeing oneself of
all grief and desire.</p>
<p>(To the Divine Mother) \"Mother, Thou hast done away with my worship.
Please see, Mother, that I don\'t give up all desire. Mother, the
paramahamsa is but a child. Doesn\'t a child need a mother? Therefore
Thou art the Mother and I am the child. How can the child live without
the Mother?\"</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna was talking to the Divine Mother in a voice that would
have melted even a stone. Again he addressed Her, saying: \"mere
knowledge of Advaita! I spit on it! Thou doest exist as long as Thou
dost keep the ego in me. The paramahamsa is but a child. Doesn\'t a
child need a mother?\"</p>
<p>M. sat there speechless and looked at the divine manifestation in the
Master. He said to himself: \"The Master is an ocean of mercy that knows
no motive. He has kept himself in the state of a paramahamsa that he
might, as teacher, awaken the spiritual consciousness of myself and
other earnest souls.\"</p>
<ol>
<li>further thought: \"The Master says,
    \'Advaita-Chaitanya-Nitayananda\'; that is to say, through the
    knowledge of the Non-dual Brahman one attains Consciousness and
    enjoys Eternal Bliss. The master has not only attained the knowledge
    of non-duality but is in a state of Eternal Blisss. He is always
    drunk with ecstatic love for the Mother of the Universe.\"</li>
</ol>
<p>With folded hands Hazara looked at the Master and said every now and
they:\"How blessed you are! How blessed you are!\"</p>
<p>MASTER (<em>to Hazra</em>): \"But you have hardly any faith; you simply live
here to add to the play, like Jatila and Kutila.\"</p>
<p>In the afternoon M. paced the temple garden alone. He was deeply
absorbed in the thought of the Master and was pondering the Master\'s
words concerning the attainment of the exalted state of the paramahamsa,
after the elimination of grief and desire. M. said to himself: \"Who is
this Sri Ramakrishna, acting as my teacher? Has God embodied Himself for
our welfare? The master himself says that none but an Incarnation can
come down to the phenomenal plane from the state of nirvikalpa
samādhi.\"</p>
<p><strong>Monday, December 24, 1883</strong></p>
<p>At eight o\'clock in the morning Sri Ramakrishna and M. were talking
together in the pine-grove at the northern end of the temple garden.
This was the eleventh day of M.\'s stay with the Master.</p>
<p>It was winter. The sun had just risen. The river was flowing north with
the tide. Not far off could be seen the bel-tree where the Master had
practised great spiritual austerities. Sri Ramakrishna faced the east as
he talked to his disciple and told him about the Knowledge of Brahman.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"The formless God is real, and equally real is God with form.
Nangta used to instruct me about the nature of Satchidananda Brahman. He
would say that It is like an infinite ocean- water everywhere, to the
right, left, above, and below. Water enveloped in water. It is the Water
of the Great Cause, motionless. Waves spring up when It becomes active.
Its activities are creation, preservation and destruction.</p>
<p>\"Again, he ued to say that Brahman is where reason comes to stop. There
is the instance of camphor.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nothing remains after it is burnt-not even a trace of ash.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>\"Brahman is beyond mind and speech. A salt doll entered the ocean to
measure its depth; but it did not return to tell others how deep the
ocean was. It melted in the ocean itself.</p>
<p>\"The rishis once said to Rāma: \'O Rāma, sages like Bharadvaja may very
well call you an Incarnation of God, but we cannot do that. We adore the
Word-Brahman. 3 We do not want the human form of God.\' Rāma smiled and
went away, pleased with their adoration.</p>
<p><strong>Different manifestations of the Absolute</strong></p>
<p>\"But the Nitya and the Lila are the two aspects of the same Reality. As
I have said before, it is like the roof</p>
<p>and the steps leading to it. The Absolute plays in many ways: as Isvara,
as the gods, as man, and as the universe. The Incarnation is the play of
the Absolute as man. Do you know how the Absolute plays as man? It is
like the rushing down of water from a big roof through a pipe; the power
of Satchidananda-nay, Satchidananda Itself-descends through the conduit
of a human form as water descends through the pipe. Only twelve sages,
Bharadvaja and the others, recognized Rāma as an Incarnation of God. Not
everyone can recognize an Incarnation.</p>
<p>\"It is God alone who incarnates Himself as man to teach people the ways
of love and knowledge. Well, what do you think of me?</p>
<p>\"Once my father went to Gaya. There Raghuvir said to him in a dream,
\'I shall be born as your son.\' Thereupon my father said to Him: \'O
Lord, I am a poor brahmin. How shall I be able to serve You?\' \'Don\'t
worry about it\', Raghuvir replied. \'It will be taken care of.\'</p>
<p>\"My sister, Hriday\'s mother, used to worship my feet with flowers and
sandal-paste. One day I placed my foot on her head and said to her,
\'You will die in Benares.\'</p>
<p>\"Once Mathur Babu said to me: \'Father, there is nothing inside you but
God. Your body is like an empty shell. It may look from outside like a
pumpkin, but inside there is nothing-neither flesh nor seed. Once I saw
you as someone moving with a veil on.\'</p>
<p><strong>Master\'s vision of Gaurānga</strong></p>
<p>(To M.) \"I am shown everything beforehand. Once I saw Gaurānga and his
devotees singing kirtan in the Panchavati. I think I saw Balarām there
and you too.</p>
<p>\"I wanted to know the experiences of Gaurānga and was shown them at
Syambazar in our native district. A crowd gathered; they even climbed
the trees and the walls; they stayed with me day and night. For seven
days I had no privacy whatever. Thereupon I said to the Divine Mother,
\'Mother, I have had enough of it.\'</p>
<p>\"I am at peace now. I shall have to be born once more. Therefore I am
not giving all knowledge to my companions. (With a smile) Suppose I give
you all knowledge; will you then come to me again so willingly?</p>
<p>\"I recognized you on hearing you read the Chaitanya Bhagavat. You are
my own. The same substance, like father and son. All of you are coming
here again. When you pull one part of the kalmi creeper, all the
branches come toward you. You are all relatives-like brothers. Suppose
Rākhāl , Harish, and the others had gone to Puri, and you were there
too. Would you live separately?</p>
<p><strong>Parable of the grass-eating tiger</strong></p>
<p>\"Before you came here, you didn\'t know who you were. Now you will
know. It is God who, as the guru, makes one know.</p>
<p>\"Nangta told the story of the tigress and the herd of goats. Once a
tigress attacked a herd of goats. A hunter saw her from a distance and
killed her. The tigress was pregnant and gave birth to a cub as she
expired. The cub began to grow in the company of the goats. At first it
was nursed by the she-goats, and later on, as it grew bigger, it began
to eat grass and bleat like the goats. Gradually the cub became a big
tiger; but still it ate grass and bleated. When atached by other
animals, it would run away, like the goats. One day a fierce-looking
tiger attacked the herd. It was amazed to see a tiger in the herd eating
grass and running away with the goats at its approach. It lef the goats
and caught hold of the grass-eating tiger, which began to bleat and
tried to run away. But the fierce tiger dragged it to the water and
said: \'Now look at your face in the water. You see, you have the
pot-face of a tiger; it is exactly like mine.\' Next it pressed a piece
of meat into its mouth. At first the grass-eating tiger refused to eat
the meat. Then it got the taste of the meat and relished it. At last the
fierce tiger said to the grass-eater: \'What a disgrace! You lived with
goats and ate grass like them!\' And the other was really ashamed of
itself.</p>
<p>\"Eating grass is like enjoying \'woman and gold\'. To bleat and run
away like a goat is to behave like an ordinary man. Going away with the
new tiger is like taking shelter with the guru, who awakens one\'s
spiritual consciousness, and recognizing him alone as one\'s relative.
To see one\'s face rightly is to know one\'s real Self.\"</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna stood up. There was silence all around, distrubed only
the by the gentle rustling of the pine-needless and the murmuring of the
Ganges. The Master went to the Panchavati and then to his room, talking
all the while with M. The disciple followed him, fascinated. At the
Panchavati Sri Ramakrishan touched with his forehead the raised platform
around the banyan-tree. This was the place of his intense spiritual
discipline, where he had wept bitterly for the vision of the Divine
Mother, where he had held intimate communion with Her, and where he had
seen many divine forms.</p>
<p>The maser and M. passed the cluster of bakul-tress and came to the
nahabat. Hazara awas there. The master said to him:\" Don\'t eat too
much, and give up this craze for outer cleanliness. People with a craze
do not attain Knowledge. Follow conventions only as much as necessary.
Don\'t go to excess.\" The Master entered his room and sat on the couch.</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna was resting after his midday meal when Surendra, Ram,
and other devotees arrived from Calcutta. It was about one o\'clock.
While M. was strolling alone under the pine-tress, Harish came there and
told him that the Master wanted him in his room. Someone was going to
read from the <em>\'Śiva Samhita</em>, a book containing instructions about
yoga and six centres.</p>
<p>M. entered the room and saluted the Master. The devotees were seated on
the floor, but no one was reading the book. Sri Ramakrishna was talking
to the devotees.</p>
<p>MASTER:\"The gopis cherished escstatic love for Krishna. There are two
elements in such love: \'I-ness\' and \'my-ness\'. \'I-ness\' is the
feeling that Krishna will be ill if \'I\' do not serve Him. In this
attitude the devotee does not look upon his Ideal as God.</p>
<p>\"\'My-ness\' is to feel that the Beloved is \'my\' own. The gopis had
such a feeling of \'my-ness\' toward Krishna that they would place their
subtle bodies under His feet lest His soles should get hurt.</p>
<p>\"Yaśoda remarked: \'I don\'t understand your Chintamani Krishna. To me
He is simply Gopala.\' The gopis also said: \'Oh, where is Krishna, our
Beloved? Where is Krishna, our Sweetheart?\' They were not conscious of
His being God.</p>
<p>\"It is like a small child saying \'my daddy\'. If someone says to the
child, \'No, he is not your daddy\', the child says, \'Yes, he is my
daddy.\'</p>
<p><strong>God, incarnated as man, acts like a man</strong></p>
<p>\"God, incarnating Himself as man, behave exactly like a man. That is
why it is difficult to recognize an Incarnation. When God becomes man,
He is exactly like man. He has the same hunger, thirst, disease, grief,
and sometimes even fear. Rāma was stricken with grief for Sita. Krishna
carried on His head the shoes and wooden stool of His father Nanda.</p>
<p>\"In the theatre, when an actor comes on the stage in the role of a holy
man, he behaves like one, and not like the actor who is taking the part
of the king. He plays his own role.</p>
<p>\"Once an impersonator dressed himself as a world-renouncing monk.
Pleased with the correctness of his disguise, some rich people offered
him a rupee. He did not accept the money but went away shaking his head.
Afterwards he removed his disguise and appeared in his usual dress. Then
he said to the rich people, \'Please give me the rupee.\' They replied:
\'Why, you went away refusing our present. Why do you ask for it now?\'
The man said: \'But then I was in the role of a holy man. I could not
accept money.\' Likewise, when God becomes man He behaves exactly like a
man.</p>
<p>\"At Vrindāvan one sees many places associated with Krishna\'s life.\"</p>
<p>SURENDRA: \"We were there during the holidays. Visitors were continually
pestered for money. The priests and others asked for it continually. We
told them that we were going to leave for Calcutta the next day, but we
fled from Vrindāvan that very night.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"What is that? Shame! You said you would leave the place the
next day and ran away that very day. What a shame!\"</p>
<p>SURENDRA (embarrassed): \"Here and there we saw the babajis in the woods
practising spiritual discipline in solitude.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Did you give them anything?\"</p>
<p>SURENDRA: \"No, sir.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"That was not proper of you. One should give something to monks
and devotees. Those who have the means should help such persons when
they meet them.</p>
<p><strong>Master\'s reminiscences of Mathura and Vrindāvan</strong></p>
<p>\"I went to Vrindāvan with Mathur Babu. The moment I came to the Dhruva
Ghat at Mathura, in a flash I saw Vasudeva crossing the Jamuna with
Krishna in his arms.</p>
<p>\"One evening I was taking a stroll on the beach of the river. There
were small thatched huts on the beach and big plum-trees. It was the
\'cow-dust\' hour. The cows were returning from the pasture, raising
dust with their hoofs. I saw them fording the river. Then came some
cowherd boys crossing the river with their cows. No sooner did I behold
this scene than I cried out, \'O Krishna, whre are You?\' and becam
unconscious.</p>
<p>\"I wanted to visit Syamakunda and Radhakunda; so Mathur Babu sent me
there in a palanquin. We had a long way to go. Food was put in the
palanquin. While going over the meadow I was overpowerd with emotion and
wept:\'O Krishna, I find everything the same; only You are not here.
This is the very meadow where You tended the cows.\' Hriday followed me
on foot. I was bathed in tears. I couldn\'t ask the bearers to stop the
palanquin.</p>
<p>\"At Syamakunda and Radhakunda I saw the holy men living in small mud
huts.</p>
<p>lest their eyes should fall on men, they were engaged in spiritual
discipline.</p>
<p>Grove\'.</p>
<p>Facing away from the road One should visit the \'Twelve</p>
<p>\"I went in to samdhi at the sight of the image of Bankuvihari. In that
state I wanted to touch it. I did not want to visit Govindaji twice. At
Mathura I dreamt of Krishna as the cowherd boy. Hriday dnd Mathur Babu
had the same dream.</p>
<p>(To Surendra) \"You have both- yoga and bhoga. There are different
classes of sages: the brahmarshi, the devarshi, and the rajarshi.
Sukadeva is an example of the brahmarshi. He didn\'t keep even one book
with him. An example of the devarhi is Nārada. Janaka was a rajarshi,
devoted to selfless work.</p>
<p>\"The devotee of the Divine Mother attains dharma and moksha. He enjoys
artha and kama as well. Once I saw you in a vision as the child of the
Divine Mother. You have both- yoga and bhoga; otherwise your countenance
would look dry.</p>
<p>\"The man who renounces all looks dry. Once I saw a devotee of the
Divine Mother at the bathing-ghat on the Ganges. He was eating his meal
and at the same time worhipping the Mother. He looked on himself as the
Mother\'s child.</p>
<p>\"But it isn\'t good to have much money. I find that Jadu Mallick is
drowned in worldliness. It is because he has too much money. Nabin
Niyogi, too, has both yoga and bhoga. I saw him and his son waving the
fan before the image of the Divine Mother at the time of the Durga
Puja.\"</p>
<p>SURENDRA:\"Sir, why can\'t I meditate?\"</p>
<p>MASTER:\"You remember God and think of Him, don\'t you?\"</p>
<p>SURENDRA:\"Yes, sir. I go to sleep repeating the word \'Mother\'.\"</p>
<p>MASTER:\"That is very good. It will be enough if you remember God and
think of Him.\"</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna had taken Surendra\'s responsibilities on himself. Why
should Surendra worry about anything?</p>
<p>It was evening. The Master was sitting on the floor of this room with
the devotees. He was talking to them about yoga and the six centes.
These are described in the <em>Śiva Samhita</em>.</p>
<p>MASTER:\"Ida, Pingala, and Sushumna are the three principal nerves. All
the lotuses are located in the Sushumna. They are formed of
Consciousness, like a tree made of wax-the branches, twigs, fruits, and
so forth all of wax. The Kundalini lies in the lotus of the Muladhara.
That lotus has four petals. The Primordial Energy resides in all bodies
as the Kundalini. She is like a sleeping snake coiled up-\'of the form
of a sleeping snake, having the Muladhara for Her abode\'. (To M.) The
Kundalini is speedily awakened if one follows the path of bhakti. God
cannot be seen unless She is awakened. Sing earnestly and secretly in
solitude:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Waken, O Mother! O Kundalini, whose nature is Bliss Eternal! Thou art
the serpent coiled in sleep, in the lotus of the Muladhara.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>\"Ramprasad achieved perfection through singing. One obtains the vision
of God if one sings with yearning heart.\"</p>
<p>M: \"Grief and distress of mind disappear if one has these experiences
but once.\"</p>
<p><strong>Proper time for spiritual unfoldment</strong></p>
<p>MASTER: \"That is true. Distress of mind disappears for ever. I shall
tell you a few things about yoga. But you see, the mother bird doesn\'t
break the shell until the chick inside the egg is matured. The egg is
hatched in the fullness of time. It is necessary to practise some
spiritual discipline. The guru no doubt does everything for the
disciple; but at the end he makes the disciple work a little himself.
When cutting down a big tree, a man cuts almost through the trunk; then
he stands aside for a moment, and the tree falls down with a crash.</p>
<p>\"The farmer brings water to his field through a canal from the river.
He stands aside when only a little digging remains to be done to connect
the field with the water. Then the earth becomes soaked and falls of
itself, and the water of the river pours into the canal in torrents.</p>
<p>\"A man is able to see God as soon as he gets rid of ego and other
limitations. He sees God as soon as he is free from such feelings as \'I
am a scholar\', \'I am the son of such and such a person\', \'I am
wealthy\', \'I am honourable\', and so forth.</p>
<ol>
<li>\'God alone is real and all else unreal; the world is
    illusory\'-that is discrimination. One cannot assimilate spiritual
    instruction without discrimination.</li>
</ol>
<p>\"Through the practice of spiritual discipline one attains perfection,
by the grace of God. But one must also labour a little. Then one sees
God and enjoys bliss. If a man hears that a jar filled with gold is
buried at a certain place, he rushes there and begins to dig. He sweats
as he goes on digging. After much digging he feels the spade strike
something. Then he throws away the spade and looks for the jar. At the
sight of the</p>
<p>jar he dances for joy. Then he takes up the jar and pours out the gold
coins. He takes them into his hand, counts them, and feels the ecstasy
of joy. Vision-touch- enjoyment. Isn\'t it so?\"</p>
<p>M: \"Yes, sir.\"</p>
<p>The Master was silent a moment and then went on.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Those who are my own will come here even if I scold them. Look
at Narendra\'s nature! At first he used to abuse my Mother Kāli very
much. One day I said to him sharply, \'Rascal! Don\'t come here any
more.\'</p>
<p>He slowly left the room and prepared a smoke. He who is one\'s own will
not be angry even if scolded. What do you say?\"</p>
<p>M: \"That is true, sir.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Narendra is perfect from his very birth. He is devoted to the
ideal of the formless God.\"</p>
<p>M. (<em>smiling</em>): \"Whenever he comes here he brings along great
excitement.\"</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna smiled and said, \"Yes, excitement indeed.\"</p>
<p>The following day was Tuesday, the ekadasi day of the lunar fortnight.
and the Master had not yet taken his meal. M., Rākhāl , and other room.</p>
<p>It was eleven o\'clock in the morning devotees were sitting in the
Master\'s</p>
<p>MASTER (to M.): \"One should fast on the eleventh day of the lunar
fortnight. That purifies the mind and helps one to develop love of God.
Isn\'t that so?\"</p>
<p>M: \"Yes, sir.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"But you may take milk and puffed rice. Don\'t you think so?\"</p>
