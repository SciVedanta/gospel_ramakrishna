<p>SRI RAMAKRISHNA AT SYAMPUKUR</p>
<blockquote>
<p>October 18, 1885</p>
</blockquote>
<p>THE DOCTORS HAD DEFINITELY diagnosed Sri Ramakrishna\'s illness as
cancer. No proper arrangement for his</p>
<p>treatment and nursing could be made at Dakshineswar. He needed the
constant attention of a physician, which</p>
<p>could not be given at the temple garden. Furthermore, the devotees who
lived in Calcutta found it very</p>
<p>inconvenient to attend on him daily at Dakshineswar. Therefore the older
devotees had rented a small two-</p>
<p>storey house in Baghbazar, Calcutta, and had brought the Master there.
Sri Ramakrishna, however, had not</p>
<p>liked the place and had gone to Balarām\'s house. In a few days a new
house had been engaged in Syampukur,</p>
<p>in the northern section of Calcutta, and the Master had been taken
there. He had been placed under the</p>
<p>treatment of Dr. Mahendra Lal Sarcar. The new building had two large
rooms and two smaller ones on the</p>
<p>second floor. One of the larger rooms was used as the parlour, and in
the other the Master lived. Of the two</p>
<p>smaller rooms, one was used as a sleeping-room by the devotees, and the
other by the Holy Mother when she</p>
<p>came there. Near the exit to the roof was a small, covered, square
space, where the Holy Mother stayed</p>
<p>during the day and prepared the Master\'s food.</p>
<p>It was Vijaya day, the fourth day of the worship of Durga, when the
image is immersed in water. On that day the Divine Mother returns to Her
heavenly abode at Mount Kailas, leaving gloom in the hearts of Her
devotees. It was eight o\'clock in the morning. The air was chilly.
Though ill, Sri Ramakrishna was sitting on his bed. He was like a five
year-old child who knows nothing but its mother. NavaGopal, M., and a
few other devotees were present.</p>
<p><strong>Master consoles Surendra</strong></p>
<p>Surendra arrived and sat down. The Divine Mother had been worshipped at
his house for the past three days. Sri Ramakrishna had not been able to
go there on account of his illness, but he had sent some of his
disciples. Surendra was in a very unhappy mood because on this day the
image of the Mother was to be immersed in the water.</p>
<p>SURENDRA \"I had to run away from home.\"</p>
<p>MASTER (to M.): \"What if the image is thrown into the water? May Mother
dwell in the heart!\"</p>
<p>Surendra was disconsolate. He was crying to the Divine Mother and
talking to Her. At this yearning of his beloved disciple Sri Ramakrishna
could not control his tears. He looked at M. and said in a choked voice:
\"What bhakti! Ah, what great love he feels for God!\"</p>
<p>MASTER (to Surendra): \"Yesterday evening at seven or seven-thirty I saw
your worship hall in a vision. I saw the divine image full of
effulgence. This place and your hall were joined by a stream of light
flowing between them.\"</p>
<p>SURENDRA \"At that time I was crying to the Mother in the worship hall.
My elder brothers had gone upstairs. I thought the Mother said, \'I will
come again.\' \" It was about eleven o\'clock in the morning. Sri
Ramakrishna finished his meal. M. poured water into his hand for him to
rinse his mouth.</p>
<p>MASTER (to M.): \"Rākhāl has indigestion.</p>
<p><strong>Praising the Gitā</strong></p>
<p>It is best to take only sattvic food. Haven\'t you read about it in the
Gitā? Don\'t you read the Gitā?\"</p>
<ol>
<li>\"Yes, sir. The Gitā speak of temperance in eating Sattvic food,
    rajasic food, tamasic food; sattvic kindness, sattvic ego, and so
    on-all these are described in the Gitā.\"</li>
</ol>
<p>MASTER: \"Have you a copy of the book?\"</p>
<p>M: \"Yes, sir.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"It contains the essence of all the scriptures.\"</p>
<ol>
<li>\'The Gitā describes various ways of realizing God. You too say that
    God can be reached by various paths: knowledge, devotion, work, and
    meditation.\"</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Secret of karma-yoga</strong></p>
<p>MASTER: \"Do you know the meaning of karma yoga? It is to surrender to
God the fruit of all action.\"</p>
<ol>
<li>\"Yes, sir, I have read that in the Gitā. It also says that there
    are three ways of performing action.\" MASTER: \"What are they?\"</li>
</ol>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
1.  \"First, one may perform karma to attain Jnāna ; second, to teach
    others; third, under the impulse of one\'s nature.\"</p>
<p>After rinsing his mouth the Master chewed betel-leaf.</p>
<p><strong>M. and Dr. Sarkar</strong></p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna was talking with M. about Dr. Sarkar. M. had been at the
doctor\'s house the previous day to report the Master\'s condition.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"What did you talk about?\"</p>
<ol>
<li>\"There are many books in the doctor\'s room. I took out one to
    read, and now and then read a passage aloud to Dr. Sarkar. It was a
    book by Sir Humphry Davy. He wrote about the necessity of Divine
    Incarnation.\"</li>
</ol>
<p>MASTER: \"Indeed! What did you say to the doctor?\"</p>
<ol>
<li>\"There was one passage that stated that Divine Truth must be made
    human truth to be appreciated by us; therefore Divine Incarnation is
    necessary.\"</li>
</ol>
<p>MASTER: \"Splendid! That\'s very good.\"</p>
<ol>
<li>\"The author gave the illustration of the sun: one cannot look at
    the sun, but one can look at its reflected rays.\"</li>
</ol>
<p>MASTER: \"Very fine. Anything else?\"</p>
<p>M: \"Another passage stated that real knowledge is faith.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"That too is very good. If one has faith one has everything.\"</p>
<p>M: \"The author dreamt of the Roman gods and goddesses.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Do such books really exist? Surely the author was inspired by
God. Did you talk of anything else?\"</p>
<ol>
<li>\"People like Dr. Sarkar speak of doing good to the world. So I told
    him what you had said about it.\" MASTER (smiling): \"What did I
    say?\"</li>
</ol>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
1.  \"About Sambhu Mallick. He had said to you: \'It is my desire to
    devote my money to the building of schools, hospitals, dispensaries,
    and the like. That will do good to many.\' Thereupon you had said to
    him, \'Suppose God appears before you; will you then ask Him to
    build schools, hospitals, and dispensaries?\' I told the doctor</p>
<p>another thing.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \'Those who are born to do work belong to a different class.
What else did you say?\"</p>
<ol>
<li>\"I said to the doctor: \'If your aim is to visit the image of
    Mother Kāli, what will you gain by spending all your time in giving
    alms to the poor by the roadside? First you had better somehow visit
    the image. Afterwards you may give alms to your heart\'s content.\"</li>
</ol>
<p>MASTER: \"Did you talk about anything else?\"</p>
<ol>
<li>\"Yes. I told him that many of those who come to you have conquered
    lust. Thereupon the doctor replied, \'I too have conquered lust.\' I
    said: \'You are a great man. It is no wonder that you have conquered
    lust. But the amazing thing is that under his influence even
    insignificant creatures have conquered it.\' Afterwards I told him
    what you had said to Girish.\"</li>
</ol>
<p>MASTER (smiling): \"What did I say?\"</p>
<ol>
<li>\"You said to Girish, \'The doctor has not been able to surpass
    you.\' You said that with reference to his calling you a Divine
    Incarnation.\"</li>
</ol>
<p>MASTER: \"Discuss the doctrine of Divine Incarnation with Dr. Sarkar. He
who liberates others is an Incarnation of God. The scriptures speak of
ten, of twenty-four, and also of innumerable Incarnations.\"</p>
<ol>
<li>\"Dr.Sarkar is keenly interested in Girish Ghosh. He always asks me
    whether Girish has given up drinking. He keeps a sharp eye on him.\"</li>
</ol>
<p>MASTER: \"Did you tell Girish about that?\"</p>
<ol>
<li>\"Yes, sir, I did. And I also told him about giving up drinking.\"
    MASTER: \"What did he say?\"</li>
</ol>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
1.  \"He said: \'Since you all say so, I take your words as the words of
    the Master himself. But I won\'t promise anything.\' \"</p>
<p>MASTER (joyously): \"Kalipada told me that he had altogether given up
drinking.\"</p>
<p>It was afternoon. Dr.Sarkar arrived accompanied by his son Amrita and
Hem. Narendra and other devotees were present.</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna was talking aside to Amrita. He asked him, \"Do you
meditate?\" He further said to him: \"Do you know!\" what one feels in
meditation? The mind becomes like a continuous flow of oil-it thinks of
one object only, and that is God. It does not think of anything else.\"</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna was talking to the devotees.</p>
<p>MASTER (to the doctor): \"Your son does not believe in the Incarnation
of God. That\'s all right, It doesn\'t matter if he does not believe in
it.</p>
<p><strong>Master praises doctor\'s son</strong></p>
<p>\"Your son is a nice boy. Why shouldn\'t he be? Does a mango-tree of the
fine \'Bombay\' variety ever bear Sour mangoes? How firm his faith in
God is! That man is a true man whose mind dwells on God. He alone is a
man whose spiritual consciousness has been awakened and who is firmly
convinced that God alone is real and all else illusory. He does not
believe in Divine Incarnation; but what does that matter? It is enough
if he believes</p>
<p>that God exists, and that all this universe and its living beings are
the manifestations of His Power-like a rich man and his garden.</p>
<p><strong>On Divine Incarnation</strong></p>
<p>\"Some say that there are ten Divine Incarnations, some twenty-four,
while others say that there are innumerable Incarnations. If you see
anywhere a special manifestation of God\'s Power, you may know that God
has incarnated Himself there. That is my opinion.</p>
<p><strong>Absolute and Relative</strong></p>
<p>\"There is another view, according to which God has become all that you
see. It is like a bel-fruit, which consists of three parts: seeds,
shell, and flesh. That which is the Absolute has also its relative
aspect, and that which is the Relative has also its absolute aspect. You
cannot set aside the Absolute and understand just the Relative. And it
is only because there is the Relative that you can transcend it step by
step and reach the Absolute.</p>
<p>\"So long as \'I-consciousness\' exists, a man cannot go beyond the
Relative. Through meditation he can negate the phenomena, following the
process of \'Neti, neti\', and reach the Absolute; but nothing can
really be denied, as in the instance of the bel-fruit.\"</p>
<p>DOCTOR: \"Quite true.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Kacha had been immersed in nirvikalpa samādhi. When his mind
was coming down to the relative plane, someone asked him, \'What do you
see now?\' Kacha replied: \'I see that the universe is soaked, as it
were, in God. Everything is filled with God. It is God alone who has
become all that I see. I do not know what to accept and what to
reject.\'</p>
<p>\"In my opinion one should realize both the Nitya and the Lila and then
live in the world as the servant of God. Hanuman saw both the Personal
God and the formless Reality. He then lived as a devotee of God, as His
servant.\"</p>
<ol>
<li>(to himself): \"So we must accept both-the Absolute and the
    Relative. Since the introduction of the Vedānta philosophy in
    Germany, some of the European philosophers, too, have been thinking
    along that line. But the Master says that one cannot realize both
    the Nitya and the Lila without complete renunciation, that is to
    say, without totally giving up \'woman and gold\'. Such a person
    must be a true renouncer; he must be totally detached from the
    world. Here lies the real difference between him and such European
    philosophers as Hegel\"</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Dr. Sarkar on Incarnation</strong></p>
<p>In Dr. Sarkar\'s opinion, God created men and ordained that every soul
should make infinite progress. He would not believe that one man was
greater than another. That was why he did not believe in the doctrine of
Divine Incarnation.</p>
<p>DOCTOR: \"I believe in infinite progress. If that is not so, then what
is the use of leading a mere five or six years\' existence in the world?
I would rather hang myself with a rope round my neck.</p>
<p>\"Incarnation! What is that? To cower before a man who excretes filth!
It is absurd. But if you speak of a man as the reflection of God\'s
Light-yes, that I admit.\"</p>
<p>GIRISH (smiling): \"But you have not seen God\'s Light.\"</p>
<p>Dr. Sarkar was hesitating before giving a reply. A friend who sat near
him whispered something into his ear.</p>
<p>DOCTOR (to Girish): \"You too have not seen anything but a reflection.\"</p>
<p>GIRISH: \"I see It! I see the Light! I shall prove that Sri Krishna is
an Incarnation of God or I shall cut out my</p>
<p>tongue!\"</p>
<p><strong>Futility of discussion</strong></p>
<p>MASTER: \"All this is useless talk. It is like the ravings of a
delirious patient. A delirious patient says, \'I shall drink a whole
tank of water; I shall eat a whole pot of rice.\' The physician says:
\'Yes, yes. You will have all these. We shall give you whatever you want
when you are convalescent.\'</p>
<p>\"When butter is heated it sizzles and crackles. But all sound comes to
a stop when it is thoroughly boiled. As a man\'s mind is, so is his
conception of God. I have seen in rich men\'s houses portraits of the
Queen and other aristocrats. But the devotees keep in their houses
pictures of gods and goddesses.</p>
<p><strong>Go beyond knowledge and ignorance</strong></p>
<p>\"Lakshmana said, \'O Rāma, even a sage like Vasishthadeva was overcome
with grief on account of the death of his sons!\' \'Brother,\' replied
Rāma, \'whoever has knowledge has ignorance also. Whoever is conscious
of light is also conscious of darkness. Therefore go beyond knowledge
and ignorance.\' One attains that state through an intimate knowledge of
God. This knowledge is called vijnāna .</p>
<p>\"When a thorn enters the sole of your foot you have to get another
thorn. You then remove the first thorn with the help of the second
Afterwards you throwaway both. Likewise, after removing the thorn of
ignorance with the help of the thorn of knowledge, you should throwaway
the thorns of both knowledge and ignorance.</p>
<p>\"There are signs of Perfect Knowledge. One is that reasoning comes to
an end. As I have just said, the butter sizzles and crackles as long as
it is not thoroughly boiled.\"</p>
<p>Doctor: \"But can one retain Perfect Knowledge permanently? You say that
all is God. Then why have you taken up this profession of a paramahamsa?
And why do these people attend on you? Why don\'t you keep silent?\"</p>
<p>MASTER (smiling): \"Water is water whether it is still or moves or
breaks into waves.</p>
<p><strong>The story of the \"Māhut Narayana\"</strong></p>
<p>\"I must tell you something else. Why should I not listen to the \'mahut
Narayana\'? The guru had taught his disciple that everything was
Narayana . A mad elephant was coming toward the disciple, but he did not
move away since he believed the guru\'s words. He thought that the
elephant was Narayana . The mahut shouted to him: \'Get away! Get
away!\' But the disciple did not move. The elephant picked him up and
threw him to the ground. The disciple was not quite dead; when his face
was sprinkled with water he regained consciousness. Being asked why he
had not moved away, he said: \'why should I? The guru said, \"Everything
is Narayana.\"\' \'But, my child,\' said the Guru, \'Why didn\'t you
listen to the words of the mahut Narayana ?\'</p>
<p>\"It is God who dwells within as the Pure Mind and Pure Intelligence. I
am the machine and He is its Operator. I am the house and He is the
Indweller. It is God who is the mahut Narayana.\"</p>
<p>DOCTOR: \"Let me ask you something. Why do you ask me to cure your
illness?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"I talk that way as long as I am conscious of the \'jar\' of
the \'ego\'. Think of a vast ocean filled with water on all sides. A jar
is immersed in it. There is water both inside and outside the jar; but
the water does not become one unless the jar is broken. It is God who
has kept this \'jar\' of the \'ego\' in me.\"</p>
<p>DOCTOR: \"What is the meaning of \'ego\' and all that you are talking
about? You must explain it to me. Do you mean to say that God is playing
tricks on us?\"</p>
<p>GIRISH: \"Sir, how do you know that He is not playing tricks?\"</p>
<p>MASTER (smiling): \"It is God who has kept this \'ego\' in us. All this
is His play, His Lila. A king has four sons. They are all princes; but
when they play, one becomes a minister, another a police officer, and so
on. Though a</p>
<p>prince, he plays as a police officer.</p>
<p>(To the doctor) \"Listen. If you realize Ātman you will see the truth of
all I have said. All doubts disappear after the vision of God.\"</p>
<p>DOCTOR: \"But is it ever possible to get rid of all doubts?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Learn from me as much as I have told you. But if you want to
know more, you must pray to God in solitude. Ask Him why He has so
ordained.</p>
<p>\"The son of the house can give a beggar only a small measure of rice.
But if the beggar asks for his train fare, then the master of the house
must be called.\"</p>
<p>The doctor remained silent.</p>
<p><strong>Master reasons with Dr. Sarkar</strong></p>
<p>MASTER: \"Well, you love reasoning. All right. Let us reason a little.
Listen. According to the Jnāni there is no Incarnation of God. Krishna
said to Arjuna: \'You speak of Me as an Incarnation of God. Let me show
you something. Come with Me.\' Arjuna had followed Sri Krishna a short
distance, when Sri Krishna asked him, \'What do you see there?\' Arjuna
replied, \'A big tree with black berries hanging in bunches.\' Krishna
said, \'Those are not black berries. Go nearer and look at them.\'
Arjuna went nearer and saw that they were Krishnas hanging in bunches.
\'Do you see now\', said Krishna, \'how many Krishnas like Me have grown
there?\'</p>
<p>\"Kavirdas said of Krishna, \'He danced like a monkey to the clapping of
the gopis!\'</p>
<p>\"As you go nearer to God you see less and less of His <em>Upādhis</em>, His
attributes. A devotee at first may see the Deity as the ten-armed Divine
Mother; when he goes nearer he sees Her possessed of six arms; still
nearer, he sees the Deity as the two-armed Gopala. The nearer he comes
to the Deity, the fewer attributes he sees. At last, when he comes into
the presence of the Deity, he sees only Light without any attributes.</p>
<p>\"Listen a little to the Vedantic reasoning. A magician came to a king
to show his magic. When the magician moved away a little, the king saw a
rider on horseback approaching him. He was brilliantly arrayed and had
various weapons in his hands. The king and the audience began to reason
out what was real in the phenomenon before them. Evidently the horse was
not real, nor the robes, nor the armour. At last they found out beyond
the shadow of a doubt that the rider alone was there. The significance
of this is that Brahman alone is real and the world unreal Nothing
whatsoever remains if you analyse.\"</p>
<p>DOCTOR: \"I don\'t object to this.\"</p>
<p><strong>Illusion persists</strong></p>
<p>MASTER: \"But it is not easy to get rid of illusion. It lingers even
after the attainment of Knowledge. A man dreamt of a tiger. Then he woke
up and his dream vanished. But his heart continued to palpitate.</p>
<p>\"Some thieves came to a field. A straw figure resembling a man had been
put there to frighten intruders. The thieves were scared by the figure
and could not persuade themselves to enter the field. One of them,
however, approached and found that it was only a figure made of straw.
He came back to his companions and said, \'There is nothing to be afraid
of.\' But still they refused to go; they said that their hearts were
beating fast. Then the daring thief laid the figure on the ground and
said, \'It is nothing, it is nothing.\' This is the process of \'Neti,
neti\'.\"</p>
<p>DOCTOR: \"These are fine words.\"</p>
<p>MASTER (smiling): \"What kind of words?\"</p>
<p>DOCTOR: \"Fine.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Then give me a \'Thank you\'.\" [The Master said the words
\"thank you\" in English.]</p>
<p>DOCTOR: \"Don\'t you know what is in my mind? I go to so much trouble to
come and visit you!\"</p>
<p>MASTER (smiling): \"No, it is not that. Say something for the good of
the ignorant. After the death of Ravana ,</p>
<p>his brother Bibhishana refused to be king of Ceylon! He said: \'O Rāma,
I have obtained You. What shall I do with kingship?\' Rāma said:
\'Bibhishana, be king for the sake of the ignorant, for those who might
ask what riches you have gained by serving Me so much. Be king to give
them a lesson.\"</p>
<p>DOCTOR: \"Are there such ignorant people here?\"</p>
<p>MASTER (smiling): \"Oh, yes! Here you will find oysters and snails as
well as conchs.\" (All laugh.)</p>
<p>Doctor Sarkar, who was a homeopath, gave Sri Ramakrishna two globules of
medicine. He said, \"I am giving you these two globules: one is Purusha
and the other is Prakriti.\" (All laugh,)</p>
<p>MASTER (smiling): \"Oh yes, Purusha and Prakriti are always together.
Haven\'t you observed pigeons? The male and female cannot live
separately. Wherever Purusha is, there is Prakriti, and wherever
Prakriti is, there is Purusha.\"</p>
<p>It was Vijaya day. Sri Ramakrishna asked Dr. Sarkar to have some
refreshments. The devotees served him with sweets.</p>
<p>DOCTOR (while eating): \"Now I say \'Thank you\' for the sweets; but it
is not for your teachings. Why should I give that \'Thank you\' in
words?\"</p>
<p>MASTER (smiling): \"The essential thing is to fix the mind on God and to
practise meditation a little. What more shall I say? (Pointing to the
younger Naren) Look at him. His mind totally merges in God. Those things
I was telling you-\"</p>
<p>DOCTOR: \"Tell the others also.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"No, a man should be given food according to his power of
digestion. Can all understand what I told you? I cannot talk to everyone
as I talked to you. Suppose a mother has bought a fish for the family.
All her children have not the same power of digestion. For some she
makes pilau and for others she makes stew. These latter have weak
stomachs.\" (All laugh.)</p>
<p>Dr. Sarkar took his leave. It was Vijaya day, when people show their
love and respect to their friends and elders with appropriate greetings.
The devotees all prostrated themselves before Sri Ramakrishna and took
the dust of his feet. Then they embraced one another. Their joy knew no
bounds. The Master was seriously ill, but he made them all forget about
his illness. The embracing and exchange of greetings continued a long
time. The devotees also took light refreshments. The younger Naren, M.,
and a few other devotees sat near Sri Ramakrishna. The Master talked to
them joyfully. He spoke of Dr.Sarkar.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"I shall not have to tell him very much. When the trunk of a
tree is cut almost to the other side, the cutter steps aside. A little
later the tree falls down of itself.\"</p>
<p>THE YOUNGER NAREN (smiling): \"Here everything is principle!\"</p>
<p>MASTER (to M.): \"The doctor has already changed a great deal, hasn\'t
he?\"</p>
<ol>
<li>\"Yes, sir. When he comes here he loses his wits. He never talks
    about medicine. When we remind him of it, he says: \'Oh, yes, yes! I
    shall have to give the medicine.\' \"</li>
</ol>
<p>Some of the devotees were singing in the parlour. They returned to the
Master\'s room. Sri Ramakrishna said: \"I heard your music; but why did
you make mistakes in the rhythm? I once heard of a man who was an adept
in discord. You sang like him.\" (All laugh.)</p>
<p>A young man, a relative of the younger Naren, arrived. He was
bespectacled and foppishly dressed. Sri Ramakrishna spoke to the younger
Naren.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"You see, a young man was going along the road. He had put on a
pleated shirt. And how he strutted! Now and again he would display the
shirt by removing his scarf, and then look around to see if anyone was
admiring him. But when he walked you could see that he was knock-kneed.
(All laugh.) The peacock displays its feathers; but its feet are very
dirty. (All laugh.) The camel is very ugly. Everything about it is
ugly.\"</p>
<p>YOUNG MAN: \"But it acts well.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Yes. But it browses on briars. It will continue to eat thorns
though its mouth bleeds. The worldly man loses his children and still
clamours for more.\"</p>
<p><strong>October 22, 1885</strong></p>
<p>It was Thursday evening, a few days after the Durga Puja. Sri
Ramakrishna sat on his bed in his room on the second floor, with
Dr.Sarkar, Ishan, and other devotees. Although Dr.Sarkar was a very busy
physician, he would spend a long time-sometimes six or seven hours-in
Sri Ramakrishna\'s company. He had great love for the Master and looked
on the devotees as his own kith and kin. A lamp was burning in the room.
Moonlight illumined the outside world.</p>
<p><strong>Master praises the true householder</strong></p>
<p>Addressing Ishan, a householder devotee, the Master said: Blessed indeed
is the householder who performs his duties in the world, at the same
time cherishing love for the Lotus Feet of God. He is indeed a hero. He
is like a man who carries a heavy load of two maunds on his head and at
the same time watches a bridal procession. One cannot lead such a life
without great spiritual power. Again, such a man is like the mudfish,
which lives in the mud but is not stained by it. Further, such a
householder may be compared to a waterfowl. It is constantly diving
under water; yet, by fluttering its wings only once, it shakes off all
trace of wet.</p>
<p><strong>Advice to householders &amp; Necessity of solitude</strong></p>
<p>\"But a man must practise some spiritual discipline in order to be able
to lead a detached life in the world. It is necessary for him to spend
some time in solitude-be it a year, six months, three months, or even
one month. In that solitude he should fix his mind on God and pray with
a longing heart for love of God. He should also say to himself: \'There
is nobody in this world who is my own. Those whom I call my own are here
only for two days. God alone is my own. He alone is my all in all. Alas,
how shall I realize Him?\'</p>
<p>\"One can live in the world after acquiring love of God. It is like
breaking the jack-fruit after rubbing your hands with oil; the sticky
juice of the fruit will not smear them. The world is like water and the
mind like milk. If you put milk in water it will mix with the water. But
first keep the milk in a quiet place and let it turn into curd. Then
from the curd extract butter. That butter you may keep in water; it will
not mix with the water, but will float on it.</p>
<p><strong>Example of Janaka</strong></p>
<p>\"Some members of the Brahmo Samaj said to me: \'Sir, our attitude
toward the world is that of King Janaka. Like him, we want to enjoy the
world in a detached spirit.\' I said to them: \'To live in the world in
a detached spirit is very difficult. By merely saying so you cannot be a
King Janaka. How much austerity Janaka practised! How long he remained
in one posture, with head down and feet up! You don\'t have to practise
these extreme disciplines. But you need <em>sādhanā</em>, you should live in
solitude. You may lead the life of a householder after having attained
divine knowledge and love in solitude. Milk turns into curd only when it
is not disturbed. The</p>
<p>curd does not set if the milk is often moved from place to place or is
too much disturbed.\'</p>
<p>\"On account of his detachment from the world Janaka was also known as
the \'Videha\', that is, one free from consciousness of the body. Though
living in the world, he moved about as a jivanmukta, a free soul living
in a body. But for most people freedom from body-consciousness is
something very far off. Intense spiritual discipline is necessary.</p>
<p>\"Janaka was a great hero. He fenced with two swords, the one of
knowledge and the other of work.</p>
<p><strong>The householder Jnāni and the monk Jnāni</strong></p>
<p>\"You may ask, \'Is there any difference between the realizations of two
jnanis, one a householder and the other a monk?\' The reply is that the
two belong to one class. Both of them are jnanis; they have the same
experience. But a householder Jnāni has reason to fear. He cannot
altogether get rid of his fear as long as he is to live in the midst of
\'woman and gold\'. If you constantly live in a room full of soot, you
are sure to soil your body, be it ever so little, no matter how clever
you may be.</p>
<p>\"After extracting the butter, if you keep it in a new pot, then there
is no chance of its getting spoiled. But if you keep the butter in a pot
where curd has been kept, well, then it is doubtful whether it will keep
its flavour. (Laughter.)</p>
<p>\"When they parch rice, a few grains jump out of the frying-pan to the
ground. These are white, like mallika flowers, without the slightest
stain on them. But the grains that remain in the pan are also good,
though not as immaculate as the fresh mallika flower. They are a little
stained. In the same way, if a monk who has renounced the world attains
divine wisdom, he appears as spotless as the white flower; but one who
stays in the frying-pan of the world after attaining Knowledge may get a
little blemish. (All laugh.)</p>
<p>\"Once a bhairavi came to King Janaka\'s court. At the sight of the
woman, the king bent his head and cast his eyes to the ground. At this
the bhairavi said, \'O Janaka, even now you are afraid of a woman!\'
Through Perfect Knowledge a man becomes like a child five years old; he
does not know the distinction between a man and a woman.</p>
<p>\"Although a Jnāni living in the world may have a little blemish, yet
this does not injure him. The moon undoubtedly has dark spots, but these
do not obstruct its light.</p>
<p><strong>Teaching others after realizing God</strong></p>
<p>\"After realizing God, some souls perform work in order to teach men.
Janaka, Nārada, and others like them, belong to this group. But one must
possess power in order to be able to teach others. The sages of old were
busy attaining knowledge for themselves. But teachers like Nārada went
about doing good to others. They were real heroes.</p>
<p>\"A worthless stick floating on the water sinks under the weight of a
bird; but a heavy and substantial log floating on the water can support
a cow, a man, or even an elephant. A steamboat not only crosses the
water itself but carries many human beings with it. Teachers like Nārada
may be compared to the heavy log of wood or the steamboat.</p>
<p>\"One man, after eating a tasty morsel, removes every trace of it by
wiping his face carefully with a towel, lest anyone should know. (All
laugh.) Another, again, having got a mango, not only enjoys it himself
but shares it with others.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge and love of God</strong></p>
<p>\"Even after having attained Perfect Knowledge, teachers like Nārada
retained love of God in their minds for the welfare of others.\"</p>
<p>DOCTOR: \"Jnāna makes a man speechless. He closes his eyes and sheds
tears. Then he needs bhakti.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Bhakti may be likened to a woman who has access to the inner
court of a house. Jnāna can go only as far as the outer rooms.\"</p>
<p>DOCTOR: \"All women are not allowed to enter the inner court, for
instance, prostitutes. Hence the need of Jnāna.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"A man may not know the right path, but if he has bhakti and
the desire to know God, then he attains Him through the force of sheer
bhakti. Once a sincere devotee set out on a pilgrimage to the temple of
Jagannath in Puri. He did not know the way; he went west instead of
south. He no doubt strayed from the right path, but he always eagerly
asked people the way, and they gave him the right directions, saying,
\'This is not the path; follow that one.\' At last the devotee was able
to get to Puri and worship the Deity. So you see, even if you are
ignorant, someone will tell you the way if you are earnest.\"</p>
<p>DOCTOR: \"But the devotee in his ignorance did lose his way.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Yes, such a thing happens, no doubt. But a man reaches the
goal in the end.\"</p>
<p>A DEVOTEE: \"Has God a form or is He formless?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"God has form and, again, He is formless. Once upon a time a
sannyāsi entered the temple of Jagannath . As he looked at the holy
image he debated within himself whether God had a form or was formless.
He passed his staff from left to right to feel whether it touched the
image. The staff touched nothing. He understood that there was no image
before him; he concluded that God was formless. Next he passed the staff
from right to left. It touched the image. The sannyāsi understood that
God had form. Thus he realized that God has form and, again, is
formless.</p>
<p>\"But it is extremely difficult to understand this. Naturally the doubt
arises in the mind: if God is formless, how then can He have form?
Further, if He has a form, why does He have so many forms?\"</p>
<p>DOCTOR: \"God has created all these forms in the world; therefore He
Himself has a form. Again, He has created the mind; therefore He is
formless. It is possible for God to be everything.\"</p>
<p><strong>Personal God and Impersonal Truth</strong></p>
<p>MASTER: \"These things do not become clear until one has realized God.
He assumes different forms and reveals Himself in different ways for the
sake of His devotees. A man kept a solution of dye in a tub. Many people
came to him to have their clothes dyed. He would ask a customer, \'What
colour should you like to have your cloth dyed?\' If the customer wanted
red, then the man would dip the cloth in the tub and say, \'Here is your
cloth dyed red.\' If another customer wanted his cloth dyed yellow, the
man would dip his cloth in the same tub and say, \'Here is your cloth
dyed yellow.\' If a customer wanted his cloth dyed blue, the man would
dip it in the same tub and say, \'Here is your cloth dyed blue.\' Thus
he would dye the clothes of his customers different colours, dipping
them all in the same solution. One of the customers watched all this
with amazement. The man asked him, \'Well? What colour do you want for
your cloth?\' The customer said, \'Brother, dye my cloth the colour of
the dye in your tub.\' (Laughter.)</p>
<p><strong>Illustration of the chameleon</strong></p>
<p>\"Once a man went into a wood and saw a beautiful creature on a tree.
Later he told a friend about it and said, \'Brother, on a certain tree
in the wood I saw a red-coloured creature.\' The friend answered: \'I
have seen it too. Why do you call it red? It is green.\' A third man
said: \'Oh, no, no! Why do you call it green? It is yellow.\' Then other
persons began to describe the animal variously as violet, blue, or
black. Soon they were quarrelling about the colour. At last they went to
the tree and found a man sitting under it. In answer to their questions
he said: \'I live under this tree and know the creature very well. What
each of you has said about it is true. Sometimes it is red, sometimes
green, sometimes yellow, sometimes blue, and so forth and so on. Again,
sometimes I see that it has no colour whatsoever.\'</p>
<p>\"Only he who constantly thinks of God can know His real nature. He
alone knows that God reveals Himself in different forms and different
ways that He has attributes and, again, has none. Only the man who lives
under the tree knows that the chameleon can assume various colours and
that sometimes it remains colourless. Others, not knowing the whole
truth, quarrel among themselves and suffer.</p>
<p><strong>Illustration of ice and water</strong></p>
<p>\"Yes, God has form and, again, He has none. Do you know how it is?
Brahman, Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute, is like a shoreless ocean.
In the ocean visible blocks of ice are formed here and there by intense
cold. Similarly, under the cooling influence, so to speak, of the bhakti
of Its worshippers, the Infinite transforms Itself into the finite and
appears before the worshipper as God with form. That is to say, God
reveals Himself to His bhaktas as an embodied Person. Again, as, on the
rising of the sun, the ice in the ocean melts away, so, on the awakening
of Jnāna, the embodied God melts back into the infinite and formless
Brahman.\"</p>
<p>DOCTOR: \"Yes. When the sun is up, the ice melts; and what is more, the
heat of the sun turns the water into invisible vapour.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Yes, that is true. As a result of the discrimination that
Brahman alone is real and the world illusory, the aspirant goes into
samādhi. Then, for him, the forms or attributes of God disappear
altogether. Then he does not feel God to be a Person. Then he cannot
describe in words what God is. And who will describe it? He who is to
describe does not exist at all; he no longer finds his \'I\'. To such a
person Brahman is attributeless. In that state God is experienced only
as Consciousness, by man\'s inmost consciousness. He cannot be
comprehended by the mind and intelligence.</p>
<p>\"Therefore people compare bhakti, love of God, to the cooling light of
the moon, and janana, knowledge, to the burning rays of the sun. I have
heard that there are oceans in the extreme north and extreme south where
the air is so cold that it freezes the water into huge blocks of ice
here and there. Ships cannot move there; They are stopped by the ice.\"</p>
<p>DOCTOR: \"Then in the path of bhakti the aspirant meets with
obstacles.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Yes, that is true. But it does not cause the devotee any harm.
After all, it is the water of the Ocean of Brahman,
Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute, that is frozen into ice. It will not
injure you if you continue to reason, saying, for instance, that Brahman
alone is real and the world illusory. This reasoning will awaken in you
Jnāna, which, like the sun, will melt the ice of divine forms back into
the infinite Ocean of Brahman, Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute.</p>
<p><strong>\"I-consciousness\"</strong></p>
<p>\"In the samādhi that comes at the end of reasoning and discrimination,
no such thing as \'I\' exists. But it is extremely difficult to attain
it; \'I-consciousness\' lingers so persistently. That is why a man is
born again and again in this world.</p>
<p><strong>Parable of the cow</strong></p>
<p>\"The cow suffers so much because she says, \'Hamba! Hamba!\', that is,
\'I! I!\' She is yoked to the plough all day long, rain or shine. Or she
is slaughtered by the butcher. But even that doesn\'t put an end to her
misery. The cobbler tans her hide to make shoes from it. At last the
carder makes a string for his bow from her entrails and uses the string
in carding; then it says, \'Tuhu! Tuhu!\', that is, \'Thou! Thou!\' Only
then does the cow\'s suffering come to an end.</p>
<p>\"Likewise, only when a man says: \'Not I! Not I! I am nobody. O Lord,
Thou art the Doer and I am Thy servant; Thou art the Master\', is he
freed from all sufferings; only then is he liberated.\"</p>
<p>DOCTOR: \"But one must fall into the hands of the carder.\" (All laugh.)</p>
<p>MASTER: \"If this ego cannot be got rid of, then let the rascal remain
as the servant of God. (All laugh.)</p>
<p><strong>Harmless and injurious ego &amp; \"Ripe ego\" and \"unripe ego\"</strong></p>
<p>\"A man may keep this ego even after attaining samādhi. Such a man feels
either that he is a servant of God or that he is a lover of God.
Sankaracharya retained the \'ego of Knowledge\' to teach men spiritual
life. The \'servant-ego\', the \'Knowledge ego\', or the \'devotee ego\'
may be called the \'ripe ego\'. It is different from the \'unripe ego\',
which makes one feel: \'I am the doer. I am the son of a wealthy man. I
am learned. I am rich. How dare anyone slight me?\' A man with and
\'unripe ego\' cherishes such ideas. Suppose a thief has entered such a
man\'s house and stolen some of his belongings. If the thief is caught,
all the articles will be snatched away from him. Then he will be beaten.
At last he will be handed over to the police. The owner of the stolen
goods will say: \'what! This rogue doesn\'t know whose house he has
entered!\'</p>
<p><strong>Childlike nature of perfect souls</strong></p>
<p>\"After realizing God, a man becomes like a child five years old. The
ego of such a man may be called the \'ego of a child\', the \'ripe
ego\'. The child is not under the control of any of the <em>Gunās</em>. He is
beyond the three <em>Gunās</em>. He is not under the control of any of the
<em>Gunās</em>-sattva, rajas, or tamas. Just watch a child and you will find
that he is not under the influence of tamas. One moment he quarrels with
his chum or even fights with him, and the next moment he hugs him, shows
him much affection, and plays with him again. He is not even under the
control of rajas. Now he builds his play house and makes all kinds of
plans to make it beautiful, and the next moment he leaves everything
behind and runs to his mother. Again, you see him wearing a beautiful
piece of cloth worth five rupees. After a few moments the cloth lies on
the ground; he forgets all about it. Or he may carry it under his arm.
If you say to the child: \'That\'s a beautiful piece of cloth. Whose is
it?\', he answers: \'Why, it is mine. My daddy gave it to me.\' You may
say, \'My darling, won\'t you give it to me?\' and he will reply: \'Oh
no, it is mine. My daddy gave it to me. I won\'t give it to you.\' Some
minutes later you may coax him with a toy or a music-box worth a penny,
and he will give you the cloth. Again, a child five years old is not
attached even to sattva. You may find him today very fond of his
playmates in the neighbourhood; he doesn\'t feel happy for a moment
without seeing them; but tomorrow, when he goes to another place with
his parents, he finds new playmates; all his love is now directed to his
new friends, and he almost forgets about his old ones. Further, a child
has no pride of caste or family. If his mother says to him about a
certain person, \'This man is your elder brother\', he believes this to
be one hundred per cent true. One of the two may have been born in a
brahmin family and the other may belong to a low caste, say that of the
blacksmiths, but they will take their meal from the same plate. A child
is beyond all ideas of purity and impurity. He is not bound by social
conventions. He doesn\'t hesitate to come out naked before others.</p>
<p><strong>\"Ego of old age\"</strong></p>
<p>\"Then there is an \'ego of old age\'. (Dr. Sarkar laughs.) An old man
has many shackles: caste, pride, shame, hatred, and fear. Furthermore,
he is bound by the ideas of worldly cleverness, calculating
intelligence, and deceit. If he is angry with anybody, he cannot shake
it off easily; perhaps he keeps the feeling as long as he lives. Again,
there is the \'ego of scholarship\' and the \'ego of wealth\'. The \'ego
of old age\' is an \'unripe ego\'.</p>
<p><strong>Characteristics of tamas</strong></p>
<p>(To the doctor) \"There are a few men who cannot attain knowledge of
God: men proud of their scholarship, proud of their education, or proud
of their wealth. If you speak to such people about a holy man and ask
them to visit him, they make all kinds of excuses and will not go. But
in their heart of hearts they think: \'Why, we are big people ourselves.
Must we go and visit someone else?\'</p>
<p>\"A characteristic of tamas is pride. Pride and delusion come from
tamas.</p>
<p>\"It is said in the Purana that Ravana had an excess of rajas,
Kumbhakarna of tamas, and Bibhishana of sattva. That is why Bibhishana
was able to receive the grace of Rāma. Another characteristic of tamas
is anger. Through anger one loses one\'s wits and cannot distinguish
between right and wrong. In a fit of anger</p>
<p>Hanuman set fire to Lanka, without thinking for a moment that the fire
might also burn down the hut where Sita lived.</p>
<p>\"Still another feature of tamas is lust.</p>
<p><strong>Turn your passions to God</strong></p>
<p>Girindra Ghosh of PathuriaGhata once remarked, \'Since you cannot get
rid of your passions-your lust, your anger, and so on-give them a new
direction. Instead of desiring worldly pleasures, desire God. Have
intercourse with Brahman. If you cannot get rid of anger, then change
its direction. Assume the tamasic attitude of bhakti, and say: \'What? I
have repeated the hallowed name of Durga, and shall I not be liberated?
How can I be a sinner any more? How can I be bound any more?\' If you
cannot get rid of temptation, direct it toward God. Be infatuated with
God\'s beauty. If you cannot get rid of pride, then be proud to say that
you are the servant of God, you are the child of God. Thus turn the six
passions toward God.\"</p>
<p>DOCTOR: \"It is very hard to control the sense-organs. They are like
restive horses, whose eyes must be covered with blinkers. In the case of
some horses it is necessary to prevent them from seeing at all.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"A man need not fear anything if but once he receives the grace
of God, if but once he obtains the vision of God, if but once he attains
Self-Knowledge. Then the six passions cannot do him any harm.</p>
<p>\"Eternally perfect souls like Nārada and Prahlada did not have to take
the trouble to put blinkers on their eyes. The child who holds his
father\'s hand, while walking along the narrow balk in the paddy-field,
may loosen his hold in a moment of carelessness and slip into the ditch.
But it is quite different if the father holds the child\'s hand. Then
the child never falls into the ditch.\"</p>
<p>DOCTOR: \"But it is not proper for a father to hold his child by the
hand.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"It is not quite like that. Great sages have childlike natures.
Before God they are always like children. They have no pride. Their
strength is the strength of God, the strength of their Father. They have
nothing to call their own. They are firmly convinced of that.\"</p>
<p>DOCTOR: \"Can you make a horse move forward without first covering his
eyes with blinkers? Can one realize God without first controlling the
passions?\"</p>
<p><strong>Paths of knowledge and devotion</strong></p>
<p>MASTER: \"What you say is according to the path of discrimination. It is
known as Jnāna yoga. Through that path, too, one attains God. The jnanis
say that an aspirant must first of all purify his heart. First he needs
spiritual exercises; then he will attain Knowledge.</p>
<p>\"But God can also be realized through the path of devotion. Once the
devotee develops love for the Lotus Feet of God and enjoys the singing
of His name and attributes, he does not have to make a special effort to
restrain his senses. For such a devotee the sense-organs come under
control of themselves.</p>
<p>\"Suppose a man has just lost his son and is mourning his death. Can he
be in a mood to quarrel with others that very day, or enjoy a feast in
the house of a friend? Can he, that very day, show his pride before
others or enjoy sense pleasures?</p>
<p>\"If the moth discovers light, can it remain in darkness any longer?\"</p>
<p>DOCTOR (with a smile): \"Of course it cannot. It would rather fly into
the flame and perish.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Oh no, that\'s not so. A lover of God does not burn himself to
death, like a moth. The light to which he rushes is like the light of a
gem. That light is brilliant, no doubt, but it is also cooling and
soothing. That light does not scorch his body; it gives him joy and
peace.</p>
<p><strong>Difficulty of path of knowledge</strong></p>
<p>\"One realizes God by following the path of discrimination and
knowledge. But this is an extremely difficult path. It is easy enough to
say such things as, \'I am not the body, mind, or intellect; I am beyond
grief, disease, and sorrow; I am the embodiment of
Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute; I am beyond pain and pleasure; I am
not under the control of the sense-organs\', but it is very hard to
assimilate these ideas and practise them. Suppose I see, my hand cut by
a thorn and blood gushing out; then it is not right for me to say:
\'Why, my hand is not cut by the thorn! I am all right.\' In order to be
able to say that, I must first of all burn the thorn itself in the fire
of Knowledge.</p>
<p>\"Many people think they cannot have knowledge or understanding of God
without reading books. But hearing is better than reading, and seeing is
better than hearing. Hearing about Benares is different from reading
about it; but seeing Benares is different from either hearing or
reading.</p>
<p>\"Those actually engaged in a game of chess do not always judge the
moves on the board correctly. The onlookers often judge the moves better
than the players. Worldly people often think themselves very
intelligent, but they are attached to the things of the world. They are
the actual players and cannot understand their own moves correctly. But
holy men, who have renounced everything, are unattached to the world;
they are really more intelligent than worldly people. Since they do not
take any part in worldly life, their position is that of onlookers, and
so they see things more clearly.\"</p>
<p>DOCTOR (to the devotees): \"If he [meaning Sri Ramakrishna] had
studied books he could not have acquired so much knowledge. Faraday
communed with nature; that is why he was able to discover many
scientific truths. He could not have known so much from the mere study
of books. Mathematical formulas only throw the brain into confusion and
bar the path of original inquiry.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"There was a time when I lay on the ground in the Panchavati
and prayed to the Divine Mother, \'O Mother, reveal to me what the
karmis have realized through their ritualistic worship, what the yogis
have realized through yoga, and what the jnanis have realized through
discrimination.\' How much I communed with the Divine Mother! How can I
describe it all?</p>
<p>\"Ah, what a state I passed through! Sleep left me completely.\"</p>
<p>The Master sang:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>My sleep is broken; how can I slumber any more?</em></p>
<p><em>For now I am wide awake in the sleeplessness of yoga.</em></p>
<p><em>O Divine Mother, made one with Thee in yoga-sleep at last,</em></p>
<p><em>My slumber I have lulled asleep for evermore.</em></p>
<p><em>A man has come to me from a country where there is no night;</em></p>
<p><em>Rituals and devotions have all grown profitless for me.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He continued: \"I have not read books. But people show me respect
because I chant the name of the Divine Mother. Sambhu Mallick said about
me, \'Here is a great hero without a sword or shield!\'\" (Laughter.)</p>
<p>The conversation turned to the performance of a drama by Girish Ghosh
called The Life of Buddha. The doctor had seen the play and been much
pleased with it.</p>
<p>DOCTOR (to Girish): \"You are a very bad man. Must I go to the theatre
every day?\"</p>
<p>MASTER (to M.): \"What does he say? I don\'t quite understand.\"</p>
<p>M: \"The doctor liked the play very much.\"</p>
<p><strong>Discussion about Divine Incarnation</strong></p>
<p>MASTER (to Ishan): \"Why don\'t you say something? (Pointing to the
doctor) He does not believe that god can incarnate Himself in a human
form.\"</p>
<p>ISHAN: \"What shall I say, sir? I don\'t like to argue any more.\"</p>
<p>MASTER (sharply): \"Why? Won\'t you say the right thing?\"</p>
<p>ISHAN (to the doctor): \"Our faith is shallow on account of our pride.
It is said in the Ramayana that a crow named Bhushandi did not at first
accept Rāma as an Incarnation of God. Once it incurred Rāma\'s
displeasure. It travelled through the different worlds-the lunar, solar,
and so forth-and through Mount Kailas, to escape Rāma\'s wrath. But it
found that it could not escape. Then it surrendered itself to Him and
took refuge at His feet. Rāma took the crow in His hand and swallowed
it. Thereupon the crow found that it was seated in it\'s own nest in a
tree. After its pride had thus been crushed, the bird came to realize
that though Rāma looked like any other man, yet He contained in His
stomach the entire universe-sky, moon, sun, stars, oceans, rivers, men,
animals, and trees.\"</p>
<p>MASTER (to the doctor): \"It is very difficult to understand that God
can be a finite human being and at the same time the all-pervading Soul
of the universe. The Absolute and the Relative are His two aspects. How
can we say emphatically with our small intelligence that God cannot
assume a human form? Can we ever understand all these ideas with our
little intellect? Can a one-seer pot hold four seers of milk?</p>
<p>\"Therefore one should trust in the words of holy men and great souls,
those who have realized God. They constantly think of God, as a lawyer
of his lawsuits. Do you believe the story of the crow Bhushandi?\"</p>
<p>DOCTOR: \"I accept as much as I want to. All difficulties come to an end
if only God reveals His true nature to the seeker. Then there can be no
confusion. How can I accept Rāma as an Incarnation of God? Take the
example of His killing Vali, the monkey chieftain. He hid Himself behind
a tree, like a thief, and murdered Vali. This is how a man acts, and not
God.\"</p>
<p>GIRISH: \"But, sir, such an action is possible only for God.\"</p>
<p>DOCTOR: \"Then take the example of His sending Sita into exile.\"</p>
<p>GIRISH: \"This too, sir, is possible only for God, not for man.\"</p>
<p>ISHAN (to the doctor): \"Why don\'t you believe in the Incarnation of
God? Just now you said that God has form since He has created all these
forms, and that God is formless since He has created the mind, which is
without form. A moment ago you said that everything is possible for
God.\"</p>
<p>MASTER (laughing): \"It is not mentioned in his \'science\' that God can
take human form; so how can he believe it? (All laugh.)</p>
<p>\"Listen to a story. A man said to his friend, \'I have just seen a
house fall down with a terrific crash.\' Now, the friend to whom he told
this had received an English education. He said: \'Just a minute. Let me
look it up in the newspaper.\' He read the paper but could not find the
news of a house falling down with a crash. Thereupon he said to his
friend: \'Well, I don\'t believe you. It isn\'t in the paper; so it is
all false.\' \" (All laugh.)</p>
<p>GIRISH (to the doctor): \"You must admit that Krishna is God. I will not
let you look on Him as a mere man. You must admit that He is either God
or a demon.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Unless a man is guileless, he cannot so easily have faith in
God. God is far, far away from the mind steeped in worldliness. Worldly
intelligence creates many doubts and many forms of pride-pride of
learning, wealth, and the rest. (Pointing to the doctor) But he is
guileless.</p>
<p>\"How guileless Keshab Sen was! One day he visited the Kāli temple at
Dakshineswar. At about four in the</p>
<p>afternoon he went around to the guesthouse, where the poor are fed, and
asked when the beggars would be fed. He didn\'t know that it was too
late in the day for the feeding of the poor. As a man\'s faith
increases, so does his knowledge of God. The cow that discriminates too
much about food gives milk in dribblets. But the cow that gulps down
everything-herbs, leaves, grass, husks, straw-gives milk in torrents.
(All laugh.)</p>
<p><strong>Childlike faith</strong></p>
<p>\"God cannot be realized without childlike faith. The mother says to her
child, pointing to a boy, \'He is your elder brother.\' And the child at
once believes that the boy is one hundred per cent his brother. Again,
the mother says that a bogy man lives in a certain room, and the child
believes one hundred per cent that the bogy man lives in the room. God
bestows His grace on the devotee who has this faith of a child. God
cannot be realized by the mind steeped in worldliness.\"</p>
<p>DOCTOR (to the devotees): \"It is not right, however, to make the cow
yield milk by feeding her all sorts of things. One of my cows was fed
that way. I drank its milk and the result was that I became seriously
ill. At first I was at a loss to know the cause. After much inquiry I
found out that the cow had been given the wrong things to eat, I was in
a great fix. I had to go to Lucknow for a change to get rid of the
illness. I spent twelve thousand rupees. (Roars of laughter.)</p>
<p>\"It is very difficult always to find out the precise relationship
between cause and effect. A child of seven months, in a wealthy family,
had an attack of whooping-cough. I was called in for consultation. Even
after much effort I could not find out the cause of the illness. At last
I learnt that the child had been given the milk of an ass that had been
drenched in the rain.\" (All laugh.)</p>
<p>MASTER (to the devotees): \"How strange! It is like saying that a man
has an acid stomach because he passed, in his coach, under a tamarind
tree.\" (All laugh.)</p>
<p>DOCTOR (with a smile): \"Let me tell you another. The captain of a ship
had a bad headache. After consultation, the doctors on board had a
blister applied to the side of the boat.\" (All laugh.)</p>
<p>MASTER (to the doctor): \"For the seekers of God the constant company of
holy men is necessary. The disease of worldly people has become chronic,
as it were. They should carry out the instruction of holy men. What will
they gain by merely listening to their advice? They must not only take
the prescribed medicine, but also follow a strict diet. Diet is
important.\"</p>
<p>DOCTOR: \"Yes, it is the diet, more than anything else, that causes the
cure.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"There are three classes of physicians: superior, mediocre, and
inferior. The inferior physician feels the patient\'s pulse, merely asks
him to take medicine, and then goes away. He doesn\'t bother to find out
whether the patient has followed his directions. The mediocre physician
gently tries to persuade the patient to take the medicine. He says:
\'Look here. How can you get well without medicine? Take the medicine,
my dear. I am preparing It with my own hands.\' But the superior
physician follows a different method. If he finds the patient stubbornly
refusing to swallow the medicine, he presses the patient\'s chest with
his knee and forces the medicine down his throat.\"</p>
<p>DOCTOR: \"There is a form of treatment that does not require the
physician to press the patient\'s chest with his knee. For instance,
homeopathy.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"There is no fear if a good physician presses the patient\'s
chest with his knee.</p>
<p><strong>Three classes of teachers</strong></p>
<p>\"Like the physicians, there are three classes of religious teachers.
The inferior teacher is content with merely giving spiritual
instruction; he doesn\'t bother about the student after that. The
mediocre teacher explains the teaching again and again for the good of
the student, that he may assimilate it; he persuades the student through
love and kindness to follow it. But the superior teacher uses force, if
necessary, on the stubborn</p>
<p>student.</p>
<p>(To the doctor) \"The renunciation of \'woman and gold\' is meant for
the sannyāsi. He must not look even at the picture of a woman. Do you
know what a woman is to a man? She is like spiced pickle. The very
thought of pickle brings water to the tongue; it doesn\'t have to be
brought near the tongue.</p>
<p><strong>Advice to householders</strong></p>
<p>\"But this renunciation is not meant for householders like you. It is
meant only for sannyāsis. You may live among women, as far as possible
in a spirit of detachment. Now and then you must retire into solitude
and think of God. Women must not be allowed there. You can lead an
unattached life to a great extent if you have faith in God and love for
Him. After the birth of one or two children a married couple should live
as brother and sister. They should then constantly pray to God that
their minds may not run after sense pleasures any more and that they may
not have any more children.\"</p>
<p>GIRISH (to the doctor, with a smile): \"You have already spent three or
four hours here. What about your patients?\"</p>
<p>DOCTOR: \"Well, my practice and patients! I shall lose everything on
account of your paramahamsa!\" (All laugh.)</p>
<p>MASTER: \"There is a river called the \'Karmanasa\'. It is very
dangerous to dive into that river. If a man plunges into its waters he
cannot perform any more action. It puts an end to his duties.\" (All
laugh.) .</p>
<p>DOCTOR (to Girish, M., and the other devotees): \"My friends, consider
me as one of you. I am not saying this as a physician. But if you think
of me as your own, then I am yours.\"</p>
<p>MASTER (to the doctor): \"There is such a thing as love for love\'s
sake. It is very good if one can grow such love. Prahlada loved God for
the sake of love. A devotee like Prahlada says: \'O God, I do not want
wealth, fame, creature comforts, or any such thing. Please grant me the
boon that I may have genuine love for Thy Lotus Feet.\"</p>
<p>DOCTOR: \"You are right, sir. I have seen people bowing down before the
image of Kāli They seek worldly objects from the Goddess, such as a job,
the healing of disease, and so forth.</p>
<p>(To the Master) \"The illness you are suffering from does not permit the
patient to talk with people. But my case is an exception. You may talk
with me when I am here.\" (All laugh.)</p>
<p>MASTER; \"Please cure my illness. I cannot chant the name and glories of
God.\"</p>
<p>DOCTOR; \"Meditation is enough.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"What do you mean? Why should I lead a monotonous life? I enjoy
my fish in a variety of dishes: curried fish, fried fish, pickled fish,
and so forth! Sometimes I worship God with rituals, sometimes I repeat
His name, sometimes I meditate on Him, sometimes I sing His name and
glories, sometime I dance in His name.\"</p>
<p>DOCTOR: \"Neither am I monotonous.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Your son Amrita does not believe in the Incarnation of God.
What is the harm in that? One realizes God even if one believes Him to
be formless. One also realizes God if one believes that God has form.</p>
<p><strong>Faith and self-surrender</strong></p>
<p>Two things are necessary for the realization of God; faith and
self-surrender. Man is ignorant by nature. Errors are natural to him.
Can a one-seer pot hold four seers of milk? Whatever path you may
follow, you must pray to God with a restless heart. He is the Ruler of
the soul within. He will surely listen to your prayer if it is</p>
<p>sincere. Whether you follow the ideal of the Personal God or that of the
Impersonal Truth, you will realize God alone, provided you are restless
for Him. A cake with icing tastes sweet whether you eat it straight or
sidewise.</p>
<p>\"Your son Amrita is a nice boy.\"</p>
<p>DOCTOR: \"He is your disciple.\"</p>
<p>MASTER (with a smile): \"There is not a fellow under the sun who is my
disciple. On the contrary, I am everybody\'s disciple. All are the
children of God. All are His servants. I too am a child of God. I too am
His servant. \'Uncle Moon\' is every child\'s uncle!\"</p>
