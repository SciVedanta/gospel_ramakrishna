<p>RULES FOR HOUSEHOLDERS AND MONKS</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sunday, March 9, 1884</p>
</blockquote>
<p>SRI RAMAKRISHNA was sitting in his room at Dakshineswar with many
devotees. Among them were Mani Mallick, Mahendra Kaviraj, Balarām, M.,
Bhavanath, Rākhāl , Lātu, and Harish. The Master\'s injured arm was in a
splint. In spite of the injury he was constantly absorbed in samādhi or
instructing the devotees.</p>
<p>Mani Mallick and Bhavanath referred to the exhibition which was then
being held near the Asiatic Museum. They said: \"Many maharajas have
sent precious articles to the exhibition-gold couches and the like. It
is worth seeing.\"</p>
<p>MASTER (to the devotees, with a smile): \"Yes, you gain much by visiting
those things. You realize that those articles of gold and the other
things sent by maharajas are mere trash. That is a great gain in itself.
When I used to go to Calcutta with Hriday, he would show me the
Viceroy\'s palace and say: \'Look, uncle! There is the Viceroy\'s palace
with the big columns.\' The Mother revealed to me that they were merely
clay bricks laid one on top of another.</p>
<p><strong>God and His splendour</strong></p>
<p>\"God and His splendour. God alone is real; the splendour has but a two
days existence. The magician and his magic. All become speechless with
wonder at the magic, but it is all unreal. The magician alone is real.
The rich man and his garden. People see only the garden; they should
look for its rich owner.\"</p>
<p>MANI MALLICK (to the Master): \"What a big electric light they have at
the exhibition! It makes us think how great He must be who has made such
an electric light.\"</p>
<p><strong>God Himself has become everything</strong></p>
<p>MASTER. (to Mani): \"But according to one view it is He Himself who has
become everything. Even those who say that are He. It is Satchidananda
Itself that has become all-the Creator, māyā, the universe, and living
beings.\"</p>
<p>The conversation turned to the museum.</p>
<p><strong>Influence of company</strong></p>
<p>MASTER (to the devotees): \"I visited the museum once. I was shown
fossils. A whole animal has become stone! Just see what an effect has
been produced by company! Likewise, by constantly living in the company
of a holy man one verily becomes holy.\"</p>
<p>MANI (smiling): \"Had you visited the exhibition only once, we could
receive instruction for ten or fifteen years.\"</p>
<p>MASTER (with a smile): \"How so? You mean illustrations?\"</p>
<p>BALARĀM: \"No, you shouldn\'t go. Your arm won\'t heal if you go here
and there.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"I should like to have two pictures. One of a yogi seated
before a lighted log, and another of a yogi smoking hemp and the
charcoal blazing up as he pulls. Such pictures kindle my spiritual
consciousness, as an imitation fruit awakens the idea of a real one.</p>
<p><strong>Obstacles to Yoga</strong></p>
<p>\"The obstacle to yoga is \'woman and gold\'. Yoga is possible when the
mind becomes pure. The seat of the mind is between the eyebrows; but its
look is fixed on the navel and the organs of generation and evacuation,
that is to say, on \'woman and gold\'. But through spiritual discipline
the same mind looks upward.</p>
<p><strong>Spiritual discipline</strong></p>
<p>\"What are the spiritual disciplines that give the mind its upward
direction? One learns all this by constantly living in holy company. The
rishis of olden times lived either in solitude or in the company of holy
persons; therefore they could easily renounce \'woman and gold\' and
\'fix their minds on God. They had no fear nor did they mind the
criticism of others.</p>
<p><strong>Will-power needed for renunciation</strong></p>
<p>\"In order to be able to renounce, one must pray to God for the will
power to do so. One must immediately renounce what one feels to be
unreal. The rishis had this will-power. Through it they controlled the
sense-organs. If the tortoise once tucks in its limbs, you cannot make
it bring them out even by cutting it into four pieces.</p>
<p><strong>Master denounces hypocrisy</strong></p>
<p>\"The worldly man is a hypocrite. He cannot be guileless. He professes
to love God, but he is attracted by worldly objects. He doesn\'t give
God even a very small part of the love he feels for \'woman and gold\'.
But he says that he loves God. (To Mani Mallick) Give up hypocrisy.\"</p>
<p>MANI: \"Regarding whom, God or man?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Regarding everything-man as well as God. One must not be a
hypocrite.</p>
<p>\"How guileless Bhavanath is! After his marriage he came to me and
asked, \'Why do I feel so much love for my wife?\' Alas, he is so
guileless!</p>
<p>\"Isn\'t it natural for a man to love his wife? This is due to the world
bewitching māyā of the Divine Mother of the Universe. A man feels about
his wife that he has no one else in the world so near and dear; that she
is his very own in life and death, here and hereafter.</p>
<p>\"Again, how much a man suffers for his wife! Still he believes that
there is no other relative so near. Look at the sad plight of a husband.
Perhaps he earns twenty rupees a month and is the father of three
children. He hasn\'t the means to feed them well. His roof leaks, but he
hasn\'t the wherewithal to repair it. He cannot afford to buy new books
for his son. He cannot invest his son with the sacred thread. He begs a
few pennies from his different friends.</p>
<p><strong>The ideal of a spiritual family</strong></p>
<p>\"But a wife endowed with spiritual wisdom is a real partner in life.
She greatly helps her husband to follow the religious path. After the
birth of one or two children they live like brother and sister. Both of
them are devotees of God-His servant and His handmaid. Their family is a
spiritual family. They are always happy with God and His devotees. They
know that God alone is their own, from everlasting to everlasting. They
are like the Pandava brothers; they do not forget God in happiness or in
sorrow.</p>
<p>\"The longing of the worldly-minded for God is momentary, like a drop of
water on a red-hot frying-pan. The water hisses and dries up in an
instant. The attention of the worldly-minded is directed to the
enjoyment of worldly pleasure. Therefore they do not feel yearning and
restlessness for God.</p>
<p><strong>Different forms of austerity</strong></p>
<p>\"People may observe the ekadasi in three ways. First, the \'waterless\'
ekadasi-they are not permitted to drink even a drop of water. Likewise,
an all-renouncing religious mendicant completely gives up all forms of
enjoyment. Second, while observing the ekadasi they take milk and
sandesh. Likewise, a householder devotee keeps in his house simple
objects of enjoyment. Third, while observing the ekadasi they eat luchi
and chakka. They eat their fill. They keep a couple of loaves soaking in
milk, which they will eat later on</p>
<p>\"A man practises spiritual discipline, but his mind is on \'woman and
gold\'-it is turned toward enjoyment.</p>
<p>Therefore, in his case, the spiritual discipline does not produce the
right result.</p>
<p>\"Hazra used to practise much japa and austerity here. But in the
country he has his wife, children, and land. Therefore along with his
Spiritual discipline he carried on the business of a broker. Such people
cannot be true to their word. One moment they say they will give up
fish, but the next moment they break their vow.</p>
<p>\"Is there anything that a man will not do for money? He will even
compel a brahmin or a holy man to carry a load.</p>
<p>\"In my room sweets would turn bad; still I could not give them away to
the worldly-minded. I could accept dirty water from others, but not even
touch the jar of a worldly person.</p>
<p>\"At the sight of rich people Hazra would call them to him. He would
give them long lectures. He would say to them: \'You see Rākhāl and the
other youngsters. They do not practise any spiritual discipline. They
simply wander about merrily.\'</p>
<p>\"A man may live in a mountain cave, smear his body with ashes, observe
fasts; and practise austere discipline; but if his mind dwells on
worldly objects, on \'woman and gold\', I say, \'Shame on him!\' But I
say that a man is blessed indeed who eats, drinks, and roams about, but
who keeps his mind free from \'woman and gold\'.</p>
<p>(Pointing to Mani Mallick) \"There is no picture of a holy man at his
house. Divine feeling is awakened through such pictures.\"</p>
<p>MANILAL: \"Yes, there is. In one room there is a picture of a pious
Christian woman engaged in prayer. There is another picture in which a
man holds to the Hill of Faith; below is an ocean of immeasurable depth.
If he gives up his hold on faith, he will drop into the bottomless
water. There is still a third picture. Several virgins are keeping
vigil, feeding their lamps with oil in expectation of the Bridegroom. A
sleeping virgin is by their side. She will not behold the Bridegroom
when He arrives. God is described here as the Bridegroom.\"</p>
<p>MASTER (smiling): \"That\'s very nice.\"</p>
<p>MANILAL: \"I have other pictures too-one of the \'Tree of Faith\' and
another of \'Sin and Virtue\'.\"</p>
<p>MASTER (to Bhavanath): \"Those are good pictures. Go to his house and
see them.\"</p>
<p>The Master remained silent a few minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Sin and repentance</strong></p>
<p>MASTER: \"Now and then I reflect on these ideas and find that I do not
like them. In the beginning of spiritual life a man should think about
sin and how to get rid of it. But when, through the grace of God,
devotion and ecstatic love are awakened in his heart, then he altogether
forgets virtue and sin. Then he leaves the scriptures and their
injunctions far behind. Thoughts of repentance and penance do not bother
him at all.</p>
<p>\"It is like going to your destination along a winding river. This
requires great effort and a long time. But when there is a flood all
around, then you can go straight to your destination in a short time.
Then you find the land lying under water deep as a bamboo pole.</p>
<p>\"In the beginning of spiritual life one goes by a roundabout way. One
has to suffer a great deal. But the path becomes very easy when ecstatic
love is awakened in the heart. It is like going over the paddy-field
after the harvest is over. You may then walk in any direction. Before
the harvest you had to go along the winding balk, but now you can walk
in any direction. There may be stubble in the field, but you will not be
hurt by it if you walk with your shoes on. Just so, an aspirant does not
suffer if he has discrimination, dispassion, and faith in the guru\'s
words.\"</p>
<p><strong>Rules for concentration</strong></p>
<p>MANILAL (to the Master): \"Well, what is the rule for concentration?
Where should one concentrate?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"The heart is a splendid place. One can meditate there or in
the Sahasrara. These are rules for meditation given in the scriptures.
But you may meditate wherever you like. Every place is filled with
Brahman-Consciousness. Is there any place where It does not exist?
Narayana, in Vali\'s presence, covered with two steps the heavens, the
earth, and the interspaces. Is there then any place left uncovered by
God? A dirty place is as holy as the bank of the Ganges. It is said that
the whole creation is the Virat, the Universal Form of God.</p>
<p><strong>Two forms of meditation</strong></p>
<p>\"There are two kinds of meditation, one on the formless God and the
other on God with form. But meditation on the formless God is extremely
difficult. In that meditation you must wipe out all that you see or
hear. You contemplate only the nature of your Inner Self. Meditating on
His Inner Self, Shiva dances about. He exclaims, \'What am I! What am
I!\' This is called the Shiva yoga\'. While practising this form of
meditation, one directs one\'s look to the forehead. It is meditation on
the nature of one\'s Inner Self after negating the world, following the
Vedantic method of \'Neti, neti\'.</p>
<p>\"There is another form of meditation, known as the \'Vishnu yoga\', The
eyes are fixed on the tip of the nose. Half the look is directed inward
and the other half outward. This is how one meditates on God with form.
Sometimes Shiva meditates on God with form, and dances. At that time he
exclaims, \'Rāma! Rāma!\' and dances about.\"</p>
<p><strong>Meaning of Om</strong></p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna then explained the sacred Word \"Om\" and the true
Knowledge of Brahman and the state of mind after the attainment of
Brahmajnana.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"The sound Om is Brahman. The rishis and sages practised
austerity to realize that Sound-Brahman.</p>
<p>After attaining perfection one hears the sound of this eternal Word
rising spontaneously from the navel.</p>
<p>\"\'What will you gain\', some sages ask, \'by merely hearing this
sound?\' You hear the roar of the ocean from a distance. By following
the roar you can reach the ocean. As long as there is the roar, there
must also be the ocean. By following the trail of Om you attain Brahman,
of which the Word is the symbol. That Brahman has been described by the
Vedas as the ultimate goal. But such vision is not possible as long as
you are conscious of your ego. A man realizes Brahman only when he feels
neither \'I\' nor \'you\', neither \'one\' nor \'many\'.</p>
<p>\"Think of the sun and of ten jars filled with water. The sun is
reflected in each jar. At first you see one real sun and ten reflected
ones. If you break nine of the jars, there will remain only the real sun
and one reflection. Each jar represents a jiva. Following the reflection
one can find the real sun. Through the individual soul one can reach the
Supreme Soul. Through spiritual discipline the individual soul can get
the vision of the Supreme Soul. What remains when the last jar is broken
cannot be described.</p>
<p><strong>Ignorance, knowledge, and Supreme Wisdom</strong></p>
<p>\"The jiva at first remains in a state of ignorance. He is not conscious
of God, but of the multiplicity. He sees many things around him. On
attaining Knowledge he becomes conscious that God dwells in all beings.
Suppose a man has a thorn in the sole of his foot. He gets another thorn
and takes out the first one. In other words, he removes the thorn of
ajnāna, ignorance, by means of the thorn of jnāna, knowledge. But on
attaining vijnāna, he discards both thorns, knowledge and ignorance.
Then he talks intimately with God day and night. It is no mere vision of
God.</p>
<p>\"He who has merely heard of milk is \'ignorant\'. He who has seen milk
has \'knowledge\'. But he who has drunk milk and been strengthened by it
has attained vijnāna.\"</p>
<p>Thus the Master described his own state of mind to the devotees. He was
indeed a vijnāni.</p>
<p>MASTER (to the devotees): \"There is a difference between, a <em>Sādhu</em>
endowed with jnāna and one endowed with vijnāna. The Jnāni <em>Sādhu</em> has a
certain way of sitting. He twirls his moustache and asks the visitor,
\'Well, sir! Have you any question to ask?\' But the man who always sees
God and talks to Him intimately has an altogether different nature. He
is sometimes like an inert thing, sometimes like a ghoul, sometimes like
a child, and sometimes like a madman.</p>
<p>\"When he is in <em>samādhi</em>, he becomes unconscious of the outer world and
appears inert. He sees everything to be full of Brahman-Consciousness;
therefore he behaves like a ghoul. He is not conscious of the holy and
the unholy. He does not observe any formal purity. To him everything is
Brahman. He is not aware of filth as such. Even rice and other cooked
food after a few days become like filth.</p>
<p>\"Again, he is like a madman. People notice his ways and actions and
think of him as insane. Or sometimes he is like a child-no bondage, no
shame, no hatred, no hesitation, or the like.</p>
<p>\"One reaches this state of mind after having the vision of God. When a
boat passes by a magnetic hill, its screws and nails become loose and
drop out. Lust, anger, and the other passions cannot exist after the
vision of God.</p>
<p>\"Once a thunderbolt struck the Kāli temple. I noticed that it flattened
the points of the screws.</p>
<p>\"It is no longer possible for the man who has seen God to beget
children and perpetuate the creation. When a grain of paddy is sown it
grows into a plant; but a grain of boiled paddy does not germinate.</p>
<p>\"He who has seen God retains his \'I\' only in name.</p>
<p>like the mark left on the coconut tree by its branch.</p>
<p>No evil can be done by that \'I\'. It is a mere appearance, The branch
has fallen off. Only the mark remains.</p>
<p><strong>The two egos</strong></p>
<p>\"I said to Keshab Sen, \'Give up the ego that makes you feel, \"I am
the doer; I am teaching people.\" \' Keshab said to me, \'Sir, then I
cannot keep the organization.\' Thereupon I said to him, \'Give up the
\"wicked ego\".\' One doesn\'t have to renounce the ego that makes one
feel, \'I am the servant of God; I am His devotee.\' One doesn\'t
develop the \'divine ego\' as long as one retains the \'wicked ego\'. If
a man is in charge of the store-room, the master of the house doesn\'t
feel responsible for it.</p>
<p><strong>God\'s manifestation through man</strong></p>
<p>(To the devotees) \"You see, my nature is changing on account of this
injury to my arm. It is being revealed to me that there is a greater
manifestation of God in man than in other created beings. God is telling
me, as it were: \'I dwell in men. Be merry with men.\' Among men God
manifests Himself in a still greater degree in pure-souled devotees.
That is why I feel great longing for Narendra, Rākhāl , and other such
youngsters.</p>
<p>\"One often sees small holes along the edge of a lake. Fish and crabs
accumulate there. Just so, there is a greater accumulation of divinity
in man. It is said that man is greater than the salagram. Man is
Narayana Himself. If God can manifest Himself through an image, then why
not through man also?</p>
<p>\"God is born as man for the purpose of sporting as man. Rāma, Krishna,
and Chaitanya are examples. By meditating on an incarnation of God one
meditates on God Himself.\"</p>
<p>Bhagavan Das, a Brahmo devotee, arrived.</p>
<p><strong>The Eternal Religion</strong></p>
<p>MASTER (to Bhagavan Das): \"The Eternal Religion, the religion of the
rishis, has been in existence from time out of mind and will exist
eternally. There exist in this Sanatana Dharma all forms of
worship-worship of God with form and worship of the Impersonal Deity as
well. It contains all paths-the path of knowledge, the path of devotion,
and so on. Other forms of religion, the modern cults, will remain for a
few days and then disappear.\"</p>
<p><strong>March 23, 1884</strong></p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna was sitting in his room after his midday meal, with
Rākhāl , Ram, and some other devotees.</p>
<p>He was not quite well. The injured arm was still bandaged.</p>
<p>But in spite of his illness, his room was a veritable mart of joy and he
the centre of it. Devotees thronged there daily to see the Master.
Spiritual talk went on incessantly, and, the very air of the room
vibrated with bliss. Sometimes the Master would sing the name and
glories of God, and sometimes he would go into <em>samādhi</em>, the devotees
being amazed at the ease with which the Master freed himself from the
consciousness of the body.</p>
<p>RAM: \"There is talk of Narendra\'s marrying Mr. R. Mitra\'s daughter.
Narendra has been offered a large dowry.\"</p>
<p>MASTER (smiling): \"Yes, Narendra may thus become a leader of society or
something like that. He will be an outstanding man, whatever career he
follows.\"</p>
<p>The Master did not much encourage the conversation about Narendra.</p>
<p>MASTER (to Ram): \"Well, can you tell me why I become so impatient when
I am ill? Sometimes I ask this man and sometimes that man how I may be
cured. You see, one must either believe everyone or no one at all.</p>
<p>\"It is God Himself who has become the physicians. Therefore one must
believe all of them. But one cannot have faith in them if one thinks of
them as mere men.</p>
<p>\"Sambhu was fearfully delirious. Dr. Sarvadhikari said that the
delirium was due to the strong medicine. Haladhāri asked the doctor to
feel his pulse. The doctor said: \'Let me see your eyes. Oh, it is an
enlargement of the spleen!\' Haladhāri said he had nothing of the sort.
But Dr. Madhu gives good medicine.\"</p>
<p>RAM: \"The medicine by itself does no good, though it greatly helps
nature.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"If that is so, why does opium cause constipation?\"</p>
<p>Ram referred to Keshab Sen\'s death.</p>
<p>RAM: \"You were quite right. You said that a gardener uncovers the roots
of a good rose-plant so that it may absorb the dew and grow stronger and
healthier. The words of a holy man have been fulfilled.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"I don\'t know about that. I wasn\'t calculating when I said
it. It is you who say that.\"</p>
<p>RAM: \"The Brahmos have published something about you in their
magazine.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Published about me? Why? Why should they write now? I eat and
drink and make merry. I don\'t know anything else.</p>
<p><strong>Man teaches by God\'s power</strong></p>
<p>\"I once asked Keshab, \'Why have you written about me?\' He said that
it would bring people here. But man cannot teach by his own power. One
cannot conquer ignorance without the power of God.</p>
<p>\"At one time two men were engaged to wrestle. One of them was Hanuman
Singh and the other a Mussalman from the Punjab. The Mussalman was a
strong, stout man. He had eaten lustily of butter and meat for fifteen
days before the day of the wrestling-match, and even on that day. All
thought he would be the victor. Hanuman Singh, on the other hand, clad
in a dirty cloth, had eaten sparingly for some days before the day of
the match and devoted himself to repeating the holy name of Mahavir. On
the day of the match he observed a complete fast. All thought that he
would surely be defeated. But it was he who won, while the man who</p>
<p>had feasted for fifteen days lost the fight.</p>
<p>\"What is the use of printing and advertising? He who teaches men gets
his power from God. None but a man of renunciation can teach others. I
am the greatest of all fools!\" (All laugh.)</p>
<p>A DEVOTEE: \"Then how is it that the Vedas and the Vedānta, and many
things besides, come out of your mouth?\"</p>
<p>MASTER (smiling): \"During my boyhood I could understand what the
<em>Sādhus</em> read at the Lahas\' house at Kamarpukur, although I would miss
a little here and there. If a pundit speaks to me in Sanskrit I can
follow him, but I cannot speak it myself.</p>
<p>\"To realize God is the one goal of life. While aiming his arrow at the
mark, Arjuna said, \'I see only the eye of the bird and nothing else-not
the kings, not the trees, not even the bird itself.\'</p>
<p>\"The realization of God is enough for me. What does it matter if I
don\'t know Sanskrit?</p>
<p>\"The grace of God falls alike on all His children, learned and
illiterate―whoever longs for Him. The father has the same love for all
his children. Suppose a father has five children. One calls him
\'Baba\', some \'Ba\', and some \'Pa\'. These last cannot pronounce the
whole word. Does the father love those who address him as \'Baba\' more
than those who call him \'Pa\'? The father knows that these last are
simply too young to say \'Baba\' correctly.</p>
<p>\"Since this injury to my arm a change has been coming over my mind. I
have been feeling much inclined to the Naralila. It is God Himself who
plays about as human beings. If God can be worshipped through a clay
image, then why not through a man?</p>
<p>\"Once a merchant was shipwrecked. He floated to the shore of Ceylon,
where Bibhishana was the king of the monsters. Bibhishana ordered his
servants to bring the merchant to him. At the sight of him Bibhishana
was overwhelmed with joy and said: \'Ah! He looks like my Rāma. The same
human form!\' He adorned the merchant with robes and jewels, and
worshipped him. When I first heard this story, I felt such joy that I
cannot describe it.</p>
<p>\"Vaishnavcharan said to me, \'If a person looks on his beloved as his
Ishta, he finds it very easy to direct his mind to God.\' The men and
women of a particular sect at Syambazar, near Kamarpukur, say to each
other, \'Whom do you love?\' \'I love so-and-so.\' \'Then know him to be
your God.\' When I heard this, I said to them: \'That is not my way. I
look on all women as my mother.\' I found out that they talked big but
led immoral lives. The women then asked me if they would have salvation.
\'Yes,\' I said, \'if you are absolutely faithful to one man and look on
him as your God. But you cannot be liberated if you live with five
men.\' \"</p>
<p>RAM: \"I understand that Kedār Babu has recently visited the
Kartabhajas\' place.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"He gathers honey from various flowers. (To Ram, Nityagopal,
and the others) If a devotee believes one hundred per cent that his
Chosen Ideal is God, then he attains God and sees Him.</p>
<p>\"People of bygone generations had tremendous faith. What faith
Haladhāri\'s father had! Once he was on the way to his daughter\'s house
when he noticed some beautiful flowers and vilwa-leaves. He gathered
them for the worship of the Family Deity and walked back five or six
miles to his own house.</p>
<p>\"Once a theatrical troupe in the village was enacting the life of Rāma.
When Kaikeyi asked Rāma to go into exile in the forest, Haladhāri\'s
father, who had been watching the performance, sprang up. He went to the
actor who played Kaikeyi, crying out, \'You wretch!\', and was about to
burn the actor\'s face with a torch. He was a very pious man. After
finishing his ablutions he would stand in the water and meditate on the
Deity, reciting the invocation: \'I meditate on Thee, of red hue and
four faces\', while tears streamed down his cheeks.</p>
<p>\"When my father walked along the lanes of the village wearing his
wooden sandals, the shopkeepers would stand up out of respect and say,
\'there he comes!\' When he bathed in the Haldārpukur, the villagers
would not have the courage to get into the water. Before bathing they
would inquire if he had finished his bath.</p>
<p>\"When my father chanted the name of Raghuvir, his chest would turn
crimson. This also happened to me. When I saw the cows at Vrindāvan
returning from the pasture, I was transported into a divine mood and my
body became red.</p>
<p>\"Very strong was the faith of the people in those days. One hears that
God used to dance then, taking the form of Kāli, while the devotee
clapped his hands keeping time.\"</p>
<p>A hathayogi was staying in the hut at the Panchavati. Ramprasanna, the
son of Krishnakishore of Ariadāhā, and several other men had become his
devotees: The yogi needed twenty-five rupees a month for his milk and
opium; so Ramprasanna had requested Sri Ramakrishna to speak to his
devotees about the yogi and get some money. The Master said to several
devotees: \"A hathayogi has come to the Panchavati. Go and visit him.
See what sort of man he is.\"</p>
<ol>
<li>young man of twenty-seven or twenty-eight, known as Thakur Dada,
    entered the room with a few friends and saluted the Master. He lived
    at Baranagore and was the son of a brahmin pundit. He was practising
    the kathakata in order to earn money to meet his family\'s expenses.
    At one time he had been seized with the spirit of renunciation and
    had gone away from his family. Even now he practised spiritual
    discipline at home.</li>
</ol>
<p>MASTER: \"Have you come on foot? Where do you live?\"</p>
<p>DADA: \"Yes, sir, I have walked from home. I live at Baranagore.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Have you come here for any particular purpose?\"</p>
<p>DADA: \"I have come here to visit you. I pray to God. But why do I
suffer now and then from worries? For a few days I feel very happy. Why
do I feel restless afterwards?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"I see. Things have not been fitted quite exactly. The machine
works smoothly if the mechanic fits the cogs of the wheels correctly. In
your case there is an obstruction somewhere.\"</p>
<p>DADA: \"Yes, sir. That must be so.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Are you initiated?\"</p>
<p>DADA: \"Yes, sir.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Do you have faith in your mantra?\"</p>
<p>A friend of Thākur Dādā said that the latter could sing well. The Master
asked him to sing.</p>
<p>Thākur Dādā sang:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I shall become a yogi and dwell in Love\'s mountain cave;</em></p>
<p><em>I shall be lost in yoga beside the Fountain-head of Bliss.</em></p>
<p><em>I shall appease my hunger for Knowledge with the fruit of Truth;</em></p>
<p><em>I shall worship the feet of God with the flower of Dispassion.</em></p>
<p><em>I shall not seek a well to slake the burning thirst of my heart,</em></p>
<p><em>But I shall draw the water of Peace into the jar of my soul.</em></p>
<p><em>Drinking the glorious Nectar of Thy blessed Lotus Feet,</em></p>
<p><em>I shall both laugh and dance and weep and sing on the heights of
Joy.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>MASTER: \"Ah, what a nice song! <em>\'Fountain-head of Bliss\'!</em> \'Fruit of
Truth\'! <em>\'Laugh and dance and weep and sing\'!</em></p>
<p>Your song tastes very sweet to me.Why should you worry?</p>
<p>\"Pleasure and pain are inevitable in the life of the world. One suffers
now and then from a little worry and trouble. A man living in a room
full of soot cannot avoid being a little stained.\"</p>
<p>DĀDĀ: \"Please tell me what I should do now.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Chant the name of Hari morning and evening, clapping your
hands. Come once more when my arm is healed a bit.\"</p>
<p>Mahimacharan entered the room and saluted the Master. Sri Ramakrishna
said to him: \"Ah! He has sung a nice song. Please sing it again.\"
Thakur Dada repeated the song.</p>
<p>MASTER (to Mahima): \"Please recite that verse, the one about devotion
to Hari\"</p>
<p>Mahimacharan recited, quoting from the Nārada Pancharatra:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>What need is there of penance if God is worshipped with love?</em></p>
<p><em>What is the use of penance if God is not worshipped with love?</em></p>
<p><em>What need is there of penance if God is seen within and without?</em></p>
<p><em>What is the use of penance if God is not seen within and without?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>MASTER: \"Recite that part also-\'Obtain from Him the love of God\'.\"</p>
<p>Mahima recited:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>O Brahman! O my child! Cease from practising further penances.</em></p>
<p><em>Hasten to Sankara, the Ocean of Heavenly Wisdom;</em></p>
<p><em>Obtain from Him the love of God, the pure love praised by devotees,</em></p>
<p><em>Which snaps in twain the shackles that bind you to the world.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>MASTER: \"Yes, Sankara will bestow the love of God.\"</p>
<p>MAHIMA: \"One who is free from bondage is the eternal Shiva.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Shame, hatred, fear, hesitation-these are the shackles. What
do you say?\"</p>
<p>MAHIMA: \"Yes, sir. And also the desire to conceal, and shrinking before
praise.\"</p>
<p><strong>Signs of Knowledge</strong></p>
<p>MASTER: \"There are two signs of knowledge. First, an unshakable buddhi.
No matter how many sorrows, afflictions, dangers, and obstacles one may
be faced with, one\'s mind does not undergo any change. It is like the
blacksmith\'s anvil, which receives constant blows from the hammer and
still remains unshaken. And second, manliness-very strong grit. If lust
and anger injure a man, he must renounce them once for all. If a
tortoise once tucks in its limbs, it won\'t put them out again though
you may cut it into four pieces.</p>
<p><strong>Two kinds of renunciation</strong></p>
<p>(To Thakur Dada and the others) There are two kinds of renunciation:
intense and feeble. Feeble renunciation is a slow process; one moves in
a slow rhythm. Intense renunciation is like the sharp edge of a razor.
It cuts the bondage of māyā easily and at once.</p>
<p>\"One farmer labours for days to bring water from the lake to his field.
But his efforts are futile because he has no grit. Another farmer, after
labouring for two or three days, takes a vow and says, \'I will bring
water into my field today, and not till then will I go home.\' He puts
aside all thought of his bath or his meal. He labours the whole day and
feels great joy when in the evening he finds water entering his field
with a murmuring</p>
<p>sound. Then he goes home and says to his wife: \'Now give me some oil. I
shall take my bath.\' After finishing his bath and his meal he lies down
to sleep with a peaceful mind.</p>
<p>\"A certain woman said to her husband: \'So-and-so has developed a
spirit of great dispassion for the world, but I don\'t see anything of
the sort in you. He has sixteen wives. He is giving them up one by
one.\' The husband, with a towel in his shoulder, was going to the lake
for his bath. He said to his wife: \'You are crazy! He won\'t be able to
give up the world. Is it ever possible to renounce bit by bit? I can
renounce. Look! Here I go.\' He didn\'t stop even to settle his
household affairs. He left home just as he was, the towel on his
shoulder, and went away. That is intense renunciation.</p>
<p>\"There is another kind of renunciation, called \'Markata Vairāgya\',
\'monkey renunciation\'. A man, harrowed by distress at home, puts on an
ochre robe and goes away to Benares. For many days he does not send home
any news of himself. Then he writes to his people: \'Don\'t be worried
about me. I have got a job here.\'</p>
<p>\"There is always trouble in family life. The wife may be disobedient.
Perhaps the husband earns only twenty rupees a month. He hasn\'t the
means to perform the \'rice-eating ceremony\' for his baby. He cannot
educate his son. The house is dilapidated. The roof leaks and he hasn\'t
the money to repair it.</p>
<p><strong>Advantage of a householder\'s life</strong></p>
<p>\"Therefore when the youngsters come here I ask them whether they have
anyone at home. (To Mahima) Why should householders renounce the world?
What great troubles the wandering monks pass through! The wife of a
certain man said to him: \'You want to renounce the world? Why? You will
have to beg morsels from eight different homes. But here you get all
your food at one place. Isn\'t that nice?\'</p>
<p>\"Wandering monks, while searching for a sadavrata, may have to go six
miles out of their way. I have seen them travelling along the regular
road after their pilgrimage to Puri and making a detour to find an
eating-place.</p>
<p>\"You are leading a householder\'s life. That is very good. It is like
fighting from a fort. There are many disadvantages in fighting in an
open field. So many dangers, too. Bullets may hit you.</p>
<p>\"But one should spend some time in solitude and attain Knowledge. Then
one can lead the life of a householder. Janaka lived in the world after
attaining Knowledge. When you have gained it, you may live anywhere.
Then nothing matters.\"</p>
<p>MAHlMA: \"Sir, why does a man become deluded by worldly objects?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"It is because he lives in their midst without having realized
God. Man never succumbs to delusion after he has realized God. The moth
no longer enjoys darkness if it has once seen the light.</p>
<p><strong>Practice of continence</strong></p>
<p>\"To be able to realize God, one must practise absolute continence.
Sages like Sukadeva are examples of an urdhvareta. Their chastity was
absolutely unbroken. There is another class, who previously have had
discharges of semen but who later on have controlled them. A man
controlling the seminal fluid for twelve years develops a special power.
He grows a new inner nerve called the nerve of memory. Through that
nerve he remembers all, he understands all.</p>
<p>\"Loss of semen impairs the strength. But it does not injure one if one
loses it in a dream. That semen one gets from food. What remains after
nocturnal discharge is enough. But one must not know a woman.</p>
<p>\"The semen that remains after nocturnal discharge is very \'refined\'.
The Lahas kept jars of molasses in their house. Every jar had a hole in
it. After a year they found that the molasses had crystallized like
sugar candy. The unnecessary watery part had leaked out through the
hole.</p>
<p><strong>Sannyasi\'s absolute self-control</strong></p>
<p>\"A sannyasi must absolutely renounce woman. You are already involved;
but that doesn\'t matter.</p>
<p>\"A sannyasi must not look even at the picture of a woman. But this is
too difficult for an ordinary man. Sa, re, ga, ma, pa, dha, ni are the
seven notes of the scale. It is not possible to keep your voice on
\'ni\' a long time.</p>
<p>\"To lose semen is extremely harmful for a sannyasi. Therefore he must
live so carefully that he will not have to see the form of a woman. He
must keep himself away from a woman even if she is a devotee of God. It
is injurious for him to look even at the picture of a woman. He will
lose semen in a dream, if not in the waking state.</p>
<p>\"A sannyasi may have control over his senses, but to set an example to
mankind he should not talk with women. He must not talk to one very
long, even if she is a devotee of God. .</p>
<p>\"Living as a sannyasi is like observing the ekadasi without drinking
even a drop of water. There are two other ways of observing the day. You
may eat fruit or take luchi. and curry. With the luchi and curry you may
also take slices of bread soaked in milk. (All laugh.)</p>
<p>(Smiling) \"Absolute fasting is not possible for you.</p>
<p>\"Once I saw Krishnakishore eating luchi and curry on an ekadasi day. I
said to Hriday, \'Hridu, I want to observe Krishnakishore\'s ekadasi!\'
(All laugh.) And so I did one day. I ate my fill. The next day I had to
fast.\" (Laughter.)</p>
<p>The devotees who had gone to the Panchavati to visit the hathayogi came
back.</p>
<p>MASTER (addressing them): \"Well, what do you think of him? I dare say
you have measured him with your own tape.\"</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna saw that very few of the devotees were willing to give
money to the hathayogi.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"You don\'t like a <em>Sādhu</em> if you have to give him money.
Rajendra Mitra draws a salary of eight hundred rupees a month. He had
been to Allahabad to see the kumbhamela. I asked him, \'Well, what kind
of <em>Sādhus</em> did you see at the fair?\' Rajendra said: \'I didn\'t find
any very great <em>Sādhu</em> there. I noticed one, it is true. But even he
accepted money.\'</p>
<p>\"I say to myself, \'If no one gives money to a <em>Sādhu</em>, then how will
he feed himself?\' There is no collection plate here; therefore all
come. And I say to myself: \'Alas! They love their money. Let them have
it.\' \"</p>
<p>The Master rested awhile. A devotee sat on the end of the small couch
and gently stroked his feet. The Master said to him softly: \"That which
is formless again has form. One should believe in the forms of God also.
By meditating on Kāli the aspirant realizes God as Kāli. Next he finds
that the form merges in the Indivisible Absolute. That which is the
Indivisible Satchidananda is verily Kāli.\"</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna was sitting on the semicircular porch west of his room,
talking with Mahima and other devotees about the hathayogi. The talk
drifted to Ramprasanna, the son of Krishnakishore. The Master was fond
of the young man.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Ramprasanna roams about aimlessly. The other day he came here
and sat in the room, but he did not speak a word. He pressed his
nostrils with his fingers, practising pranayama. I offered him something
to eat, but he wouldn\'t take it. On another occasion I had asked him to
sit by me. He squatted on the floor placing one leg upon the other. He
was rather discourteous to Captain. I weep at his mother\'s suffering.</p>
<p>(To Mahima) \"Ramprasanna asked me to speak to you about the hathayogi.
The yogi\'s daily expenses are six</p>
<p>and a half <em>ānnās</em>. But he won\'t tell you about it himself.\"</p>
<p>MAHIMA: \"Who will listen to him even if he does?\"</p>
<p>Mani Sen of Panihati entered the room with several friends, one of whom
was a physician. Mani asked the Master about his injured arm. The doctor
did not approve of the medicine prescribed by Pratap Mazumdar. The
Master said to him: \"Why should you say that? Pratap is no fool. \"</p>
<p>Suddenly Lātu cried out, \"Oh! The medicine bottle has dropped and
broken.\"</p>
<p>It was not yet dusk. The Master, seated on the couch, was talking to M.
Mahimacharan was on the semicircular porch engaged in a loud discussion
of the scriptures with the physician friend of Mani Sen. Sri Ramakrishna
heard it and with a smile said to M.: \"There! He is delivering himself.
That is the characteristic of rajas. It stimulates the desire to
\'lecture\' and to show off one\'s scholarship. But sattva makes one
introspective. It makes one hide one\'s virtues. But I must say that
Mahima is a grand person. He takes such delight in spiritual talk.\"</p>
<p>Adhar entered the room, saluted the Master, and sat by M.\'s side. He
had not come for the past few days.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Hello! Why haven\'t you come all these days?\"</p>
<p>ADHAR: \"Sir, I have been busy with so many things. I had to attend a
conference of the school committee and various other meetings.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"So you completely lost yourself in schools and meetings and
forgot everything else?\"</p>
<p>ADHAR: \"Everything else was hidden away in a corner of my mind. How is
your arm?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Just look. It is not yet healed. I have been taking medicine
prescribed by Pratap.\"</p>
<p>After a time the Master suddenly said to Adhar: \"Look here. All these
are unreal-meetings, school, office, and everything else. God alone is
the Substance, and all else is illusory. One should worship God with
one\'s whole mind.\"</p>
<p>Adhar sat without speaking a word.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"All else is illusory. This moment the body is and the next
moment it is not. One must make haste to worship God.</p>
<p>\"But you don\'t have to renounce everything. Live in the world the way
the tortoise does. The tortoise roams about in the water but keeps its
eggs on land. Its whole mind is on the eggs.</p>
<p>\"What a nice state of mind Captain has developed! He looks like a rishi
when he is seated to perform worship. He performs the <em>Ārati</em> with
lighted camphor and recites beautiful hymns. When he rises from his seat
after finishing the worship, his eyes are swollen from emotion, as if
bitten by ants. Besides, he always devotes himself to the study of the
sacred books, such as the Gitā and the Bhagavata. Once I used one or two
English words before him, and that made him angry. He said,
\'English-educated people are profane.\' \"</p>
<p>After a while Adhar said humbly to the Master: \"Sir, you haven\'t been
to our place for a long time. The drawing-room smells worldly and
everything else appears to be steeped in darkness.\"</p>
<p>The Master was deeply touched by these words of his devotee. He suddenly
stood up and blessed M. and Adhar in an ecstatic mood, touching their
heads and hearts. In a voice choked with love the Master said: \"I look
upon you as Narayana Himself. You are indeed my own.\"</p>
<p>Mahimacharan entered the room.</p>
<p>MASTER (to Mahima): \"What I said about aspirants practising continence
is true. Without chastity one cannot assimilate these teachings.</p>
<p>\"Once a man said to Chaitanya: \'You give the devotees so much
instruction. Why don\'t they make much progress?\' Chaitanya said:
\'They dissipate their powers in the company of women. That is why they
cannot assimilate spiritual instruction. If one keeps water in a leaky
jar, the water escapes little by little through the leak.\' \"</p>
<p>Mahima and the other devotees remained silent. After a time Mahima said,
\"Please pray to God for us that we may acquire the necessary
strength.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Be on your guard even now. It is difficult, no doubt, to check
the torrent in the rainy season. But a great deal of water has gone out.
If you build the embankment now it will stand.</p>
