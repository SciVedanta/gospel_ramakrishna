<p>THE MASTER\'S REMINISCENCES</p>
<blockquote>
<p>April 12, 1885</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Master\'s own reminiscences</strong></p>
<p>SRI RAMAKRISHNA was sitting with the devotees in Balarām\'s drawing room
in Calcutta. M. arrived at three o\'clock. Girish, Balarām, the younger
Naren, Paltu, Dwija, Purna, Mahendra Mukherji, and many other devotees
were there. Shortly Trailokya Sannyal, Jaygopal Sen, and other members
of the Brahmo Samaj arrived. Many woman devotees were present also,
seated behind a screen. Among them was Mohini\'s wife, who had almost
gone insane on account of her son\'s death. There were a few other
afflicted souls like her who used to visit the Master to obtain peace of
mind.</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna was describing to the devotees the various incidents of
his <em>sādhanā</em> and the phases of his spiritual realization.</p>
<p><strong>Various forms of his meditation</strong></p>
<p>MASTER: \"During my <em>sādhanā</em>, when I meditated, I would actually see a
person sitting neat me with a trident in his hand. He would threaten to
strike me with the weapon unless I fixed my mind on the Lotus Feet of
God, warning me that it would pierce my breast if my mind strayed from
God.</p>
<p>\"The Divine Mother would put me in such a state that sometimes my mind
would come down from the Nitya to the Lila, and sometimes go up from the
Lila to the Nitya.</p>
<p>\"Sometimes, when the mind descended to the Lila, I would meditate day
and night on Sita and Rāma. At those times I would constantly behold the
forms of Sita and Rāma. Rāmlāla was my constant companion. Sometimes I
would bathe Him and sometimes feed Him.</p>
<p>\"Again, I used to be absorbed in the ideal of Radha and Krishna and
would constantly see their forms. Or again, I would be absorbed in
Gaurānga. He is the harmonization of two ideals: the Purusha and the
Prakriti. At such times I would always see the form of Gaurānga.</p>
<p><strong>Master\'s meditation on formless Spirit</strong></p>
<p>\"Then a change came over me. The mind left the plane of the Lila and
ascended to the Nitya. I found no distinction between the sacred tulsi
and the ordinary sajina plant. I no longer enjoyed seeing the forms of
God; I said to myself, \'They come and go.\' I lifted my mind above
them. I removed all the pictures of gods and goddesses from my room and
began to meditate on the Primal Purusha, the Indivisible Satchidananda,
regarding myself as His handmaid.</p>
<p><strong>Three kinds of <em>sādhanā</em></strong></p>
<p>\"I practised all sorts of <em>sādhanā</em>. There are three classes of
<em>sādhanā</em>: sattvic, rajasic, and tamasic. In the sattvic <em>sādhanā</em> the
devotee calls on the Lord with great longing or simply repeats His name;
he doesn\'t seek any result in return. The rajasic <em>sādhanā</em> prescribes
many rituals: purascharana, pilgrimage, panchatapa, worship with sixteen
articles, and so forth. The tamasic <em>sādhanā</em> is a worship of God with
the help of tamas. The attitude of a tamasic devotee is this: \'Hail,
Kāli! What? Wilt Thou not reveal Thyself to me? If not, I will cut my
throat with a knife!\' In this discipline one does not observe
conventional purity; it is like some of the disciplines prescribed by
the Tantra.</p>
<p>\"During my <em>sādhanā</em> period I had all kinds of amazing visions. I
distinctly perceived the communion of Ātman. A person exactly resembling
me entered my body and began to commune with each one of the six
lotuses. The petals of these lotuses had been closed; but as each of
them experienced the communion, the drooping flower bloomed and turned
itself upward. Thus blossomed forth the lotuses at the centres of
Muladhara, Svadhisthana, Anāhata, Visuddha, Ājnā, and Sahasrara. The
drooping flowers turned upward. I perceived all these things</p>
<p>directly.</p>
<p>\"When I meditated during my <em>sādhanā</em>, I used to think of the
unflickering flame of a lamp set in a windless place.</p>
<p><strong>Nature of deep concentration</strong></p>
<p>\"In deep meditation a man is not at all conscious of the outer world. A
hunter was aiming at a bird. A bridal procession passed along beside
him, with the groom\'s relatives and friends, music, carriages, and
horses. It took a long time for the procession to pass the hunter, but
he was not at all conscious of it. He did not know that the bridegroom
had gone by.</p>
<p>\"A man was angling in a lake all by himself. After a long while the
float began to move. Now and then its tip touched the water. The angler
was holding the rod tight in his hands, ready to pull it up, when a
passer-by stopped and said, \'Sir, can you tell me where Mr. Bannerji
lives?\' There was no reply from the angler, who was just on the point
of pulling up the rod. Again and again the stranger said to him in a
loud voice, \'Sir, can you tell me where Mr. Bannerji lives?\' But the
angler was unconscious of everything around him. His hands were
trembling, his eyes fixed on the float. The stranger was annoyed and
went on. When he had gone quite a way, the angler\'s float sank under
water and with one pull of the rod he landed the fish. He wiped the
sweat from his face with his towel and shouted after the stranger.
\'Hey!\' he said. \'Come here! Listen!\' But the man would not turn his
face. After much shouting, however, he came back and said to the angler,
\'Why are you shouting at me?\' \'What did you ask me about?\' said .the
angler. The stranger said, \'I repeated the question so many times and
now you art asking me to repeat it once more!\' The angler replied, \'At
that time my float was about to sink; so I didn\'t hear a word of what
you said.\'</p>
<p><strong>Single-mindedness in meditation</strong></p>
<p>\"A person can achieve such single-mindedness in meditation that he will
see nothing, hear nothing. He will not be conscious even of touch. A
snake may crawl over his body, but he will not know it. Neither of them
will be aware of the other.</p>
<p>\"In deep meditation the sense-organs stop functioning; the mind does
not look outward. It is like closing the gate of the outer court in a
house. There are five objects of the senses: form, taste, smell, touch,
and sound. They are all left outside.</p>
<p>\"At the beginning of meditation the objects of the senses appear before
the aspirant. But when the meditation becomes deep, they no longer
bother him. They are left outside. How many things I saw during
meditation! I vividly perceived before me a heap of rupees, a shawl, a
plate of sweets, and two women with rings in their noses. \'What do you
want?\' I asked my mind. \'Do you want to enjoy any of these things?\'
\'No,\' replied the mind, \'I don\'t want any of them. I don\'t want
anything but the Lotus Feet of God.\' I saw the inside and the outside
of the women, as one sees from out side the articles in a glass room. I
saw what is in them: entrails, blood, filth, worms, phlegm, and such
things.\"</p>
<p>Girish Chandra Ghosh used to say now and then that he could cure illness
by the strength of the Master\'s name.</p>
<p><strong>Occult powers</strong></p>
<p>MASTER (to Girish and the other devotees): \"People of small intellect
seek occult powers-powers to cure disease, win a lawsuit, walk on water,
and such things. But the genuine devotees of God don\'t want anything
except His Lotus Feet. One day Hriday said to me, \'Uncle, please ask
the Mother for some powers, some occult powers.\' I have the nature of a
child. While I was practising japa in the Kāli temple, I said to Kāli,
\'Mother, Hriday asked me to pray to You for some occult powers.\' The
Divine Mother at once showed me a vision. A middle-aged prostitute,
about forty years old, appeared and sat with her back to me. She had
large hips and wore a black-bordered sari. Soon she was covered with
filth. The Mother showed me that occult powers are as abominable as the
filth of that prostitute. Thereupon I went to Hriday and scolded him,
saying: \'why did you</p>
<p>teach me such a prayer? It is because of you that I had such an
experience.\'</p>
<p><strong>A false teacher</strong></p>
<p>\"People with a little occult power gain such things as name and fame.
Many of them want to follow the profession of guru, gain people\'s
recognition, and make disciples and devotees. Men say of such a guru:
\'Ah! He is having a wonderful time. How many people visit him! He has
many disciples and followers. His house is overflowing with furniture
and other things. People give him presents. He has such power that he
can feed many people if he so desires.\'</p>
<p>\"The profession of a teacher is like that of a prostitute. It is the
selling of oneself for the trifle of money, honour, and creature
comforts. For such insignificant things it is not good to prostitute the
body, mind, and soul, the means by which one can attain God. A man once
said about a certain woman: \'Ah! She is having a grand time now. She is
so well off! She has rented a room and furnished it with a couch, a mat,
pillows, and many other things. And how many people she controls! They
are always visiting her.\' In other words, the woman has now become a
prostitute. Therefore her happiness is unbounded. Formerly she was a
maidservant in a gentleman\'s house; now she is a prostitute. She has
ruined herself for a mere trifle.</p>
<p><strong>Master\'s visions during <em>sādhanā</em></strong></p>
<p>\"How many other visions I saw while meditating during my <em>sādhanā</em>!
Once I was meditating under the bel-tree when \'Sin\' appeared before me
and tempted me in various ways. He came to me in the form of an English
soldier. He wanted to give me wealth, honour, sex pleasure, various
occult powers, and such things. I began to pray to the Divine Mother.
Now I am telling you something very secret. The Mother appeared. I said
to Her, \'Kill him, Mother!\' I still remember that form of the Mother,
Her world bewitching beauty. She came to me taking the form of
Krishnamayi. But it was as if her glance moved the world.\"</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna became silent. Resuming his reminiscences, he said:
\"How many other visions I saw! But I am not permitted to tell them.
Someone is shutting my mouth, as it were. I used to find no distinction
between the sacred tulsi and the insignificant sajina leaf. The feeling
of distinction was entirely destroyed. Once I was meditating under the
banyan when I was shown a Musslman with a long beard. He came to me with
rice in an earthen plate. He fed some other Musslmans with the rice and
also gave me a few grains to eat. The Mother showed me that there exists
only One, and not two. It is Satchidananda alone that has taken all
these various forms; He alone has become the world and its living
beings. Again, it is He who has become food.</p>
<p>(To Girish, M., and the others) \"I have the nature of a child. Hriday
said to me, \'Uncle, ask the Mother for some occult powers.\' At once I
went to the temple to ask Her about them. At that time God had put me in
such a state that I had to listen to those who lived with me. I felt
like a child who sees darkness all around unless someone is with him. I
felt as if I should die unless Hriday was near me. You see I am in that
state of mind just now.While I am speaking to you my inner spirit is
being awakened.\"</p>
<p>As Sri Ramakrishna uttered these words, he was on the point of plunging
into samādhi and losing consciousness of time and space. But he was
trying with the utmost difficulty to control himself. He said to the
devotees in an ecstatic mood: \"I still see you. But I feel as if you
had been sitting here forever. I don\'t recall when you came or where
you are.\"</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna was silent a few minutes. Then, regaining partial
consciousness, he said, \"I shall have a drink of water.\" He often said
things like this after samādhi, in order to bring down his mind to the
ordinary plane of consciousness. Girish was a newcomer and did not know
this; so he started to bring some water. Sri Ramakrishna asked him not
to, saying, \"No, my dear sir, I cannot drink now.\"</p>
<p>The Master and the devotees were silent a while. Sri Ramakrishna resumed
the conversation.</p>
<p>MASTER: (to M.):\"Well,have I done any wrong in telling these secret
experiences?\"</p>
<p>M. did not know what to say and kept quiet.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Why should there be any harm in it? I have told these things
to create faith in you all.\"</p>
<p>After a while he said to M. very humbly, \"Will you kindly bring him
here?\" He referred to Purna.</p>
<p>M. (hesitating): \"Yes, Sir. I shall send for him this very moment.</p>
<p>MASTER (eagerly): \"In Purna I have reached the \'post\'. Was Sri
Ramakrishna hinting that Purna was perhaps the last devotee of his inner
circle?</p>
<p><strong>Experience of mahabhava</strong></p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna then described to Girish, M., and the other devotees his
own experience of mahabhava.</p>
<p>MASTER (to the devotees): \"My joy after that experience was equal to
the pain I suffered before it. Mahabhava is a divine ecstasy; it shakes
the body and mind to their very foundation. It is like a huge elephant
entering a small hut. The house shakes to its foundation. Perhaps it
falls to pieces.</p>
<p>\"The burning pain that one feels when one is separated from God is not
an ordinary feeling. It is said that the fire of this anguish in Rupa
and Sanatana scorched the leaves of the tree under which they sat. I was
unconscious three days in that state. I couldn\'t move. I lay in one
place. When I regained consciousness, the Brahmani took me out for a
bath. But my skin couldn\'t bear the touch of her hand; so my body had
to be covered with a heavy sheet. Only then could she hold me with her
hand and lead me to the bathing-place. The earth that had stuck to my
body while I was lying on the ground had become baked.</p>
<p>\"In that state I felt as if a ploughshare were passing through my
back-bone. I cried out: \'Oh, I am dying! I am dying!\' But afterwards I
was filled with great joy.\"</p>
<p>The devotees listened breathlessly to these experiences of the Master.</p>
<p>MASTER (to Girish): \"But it isn\'t necessary for you to go so far. My
experiences are for others to refer to. You busy yourself with five
different things, but I have one ideal only. I do not enjoy anything but
God. This is what God has ordained for me. (Smiling) There are different
trees in the forest, some shooting up with one trunk and others
spreading out with five branches. (All smile.)</p>
<p>\"Yes, my experiences are for others to refer to. But you should live in
the world in a spirit of detachment. You will no doubt have dirt on your
body, but you must shake it off as the mudfish shakes off the mud. You
may swim in the black ocean of the world, but your body should not be
stained.\"</p>
<p>GIRISH (smiling): \"But you too had to marry.\" (Laughter.)</p>
<p>MASTER (smiling): \"Marriage is necessary for the sake of samskara. But
how could I lead a worldly life? So uncontrollable was my divine fervour
that every time the sacred thread was put around my neck it dropped off.
Some believe that Sukadeva also had to marry-for the sake of samskara.
They say he even had a daughter. (All laugh.)</p>
<p><strong>Power of \"woman and gold\"</strong></p>
<p>\"\'Woman and gold\' alone is the world. It makes one forget God.\"</p>
<p>GIRISH: \"But how can we get rid of \'woman and gold\'?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Pray to God with a yearning heart. Pray to Him for
discrimination. \'God alone is real and all else illusory\'-this is
discrimination. One strains water through a fine sieve in order to
separate the dirt from it. The clear water goes through the sieve
leaving the dirt behind. Apply the sieve of discrimination to the world.
Live in the world after knowing God. Then it will be the world of vidyā.</p>
<p>\"Just see the bewitching power of women! I mean the women who are the
embodiment of avidyā, the power of delusion. They fool men, as it were.
They take away their inner substance. When I see a man and woman sitting
together, I say to myself, \'Alas, they are done for\' (Looking at M.)
Haru, such a nice boy, is possessed by a witch. People ask: \'Where is
Haru? Where is he?\' But where do you expect him to be? They all go to
the banyan and find him sitting quietly under it. He no longer has his
beauty, power, or joy. Ah! He is possessed by the witch that lives in
the banyan.</p>
<p>\"If a woman says to her husband, \'Go there\', he at once stands up,
ready to go. If she says, \'Sit down here\', immediately he sits down.</p>
<p>\"A job-seeker got tired of visiting the manager in an office. He
couldn\'t get the job. The manager said to him, \'There is no vacancy
now; but come and see me now and then.\' This went on for a long time,
and the candidate lost all hope. One day he told his tale of woe to a
friend. The friend said: \'How stupid you are! Why are you wearing away
the soles of your feet going to that fellow? You had better go to Golap.
You will get the job tomorrow.\' \'Is that so?\' said the candidate. \'I
am going right away.\' Golap was the manager\'s mistress. The candidate
called on her and said: \'Mother, I am in great distress. You must help
me out of it. I am the son of a poor brahmin. Where else shall I go for
help? Mother, I have been out of work many days. My children are about
to starve to death. I can get a job if you but say the word.\' Golap
said to him, \'Child, whom should I speak to?\' She said to herself:
\'Ah, the poor brahmin! He has been suffering too much.\' The candidate
said to her, \'I am sure to get the job if you just put in a word about
it to the manager.\' Golap said, \'I shall speak to him today and settle
the matter.\' The very next morning a man called on the candidate and
said, \'You are to work in the manager\'s office, beginning today.\' The
manager said to his English boss: \'This man is very competent. I have
appointed him. He will do credit to the firm.\'</p>
<p>\"All are deluded by \'woman and gold\'. But I do not care for it at
all. And I swear to you that I do not know anything but God.\"</p>
<p>A DEVOTEE: \"Sir, a new sect, named, \'Nava Hullol\', has been started.
Lalit Chatterji is one of the members.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"There are different views. All these views are but so many
paths to reach the same goal. But everyone believes that his view alone
is right, that his watch alone keeps correct time.\"</p>
<p>GIRISH (to M.): \"Do you remember what Pope says about it?</p>
<p>\'Tis with our judgments as our watches, none</p>
<p>Go just alike, yet each believes his own.\"</p>
<p>MASTER (to M.): \"What does it mean?\"</p>
<ol>
<li>\"Every one thinks that his own watch keeps the correct time. But
    different watches do not give the same time.\"</li>
</ol>
<p>MASTER: \"But however wrong the watches may be, the Sun never makes a
mistake. One should check one\'s watch with the sun.\"</p>
<p>A DEVOTEE: Mr. X- tells lies.</p>
<p><strong>Efficacy of truthfulness</strong></p>
<p>MASTER: \"Truthfulness in speech is the <em>tapasya</em> of the Kaliyuga. It is
difficult to practise other austerities in this cycle. By adhering to
truth one attains God. Tulsidas said: \'Truthfulness, obedience to God,
and the regarding of others\' wives as one\'s mother, are the greatest
virtues. If one does not realize God by practising them, then Tulsi is a
liar.\'</p>
<p>\"Keshab Sen assumed his father\'s debts. Others would have repudiated
them. I visited Devendra\'s Samaj at</p>
<p>Jorashanko and found Keshab meditating on the dais. He was then a young
man. I said to Mathur Babu, \'Of all who are meditating here, this young
man\'s \"float\" alone has sunk under water. The \"fish\" is biting at
the hook.\'</p>
<p>\"There was a man-whom I shall not name-who for ten thousand rupees told
a lie in court. In order to win the lawsuit he made me give an offering
to the Divine Mother. He said to me, \'Father, please give this offering
to the Mother.\' Trusting him like a child, I gave the offering.\"</p>
<p>DEVOTEE: \"A nice man indeed!\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"But he had such faith in me that he believed the Mother would
grant his prayer if I but made the offering.\"</p>
<p>Referring to Lalit Babu, Sri Ramakrishna said: \"Is it an easy matter to
get rid of pride? There are very few who are without pride. Balarām is
one of them. (Pointing to a devotee) And here is another. Other people
in their position would have swelled with pride. They would have parted
their hair and showed other traits of tamas. They would have been proud
of their learning. The \'fat brahmin\' [referring to Prankrishna]
still has a little of it.</p>
<p>To M.) Mahima Chakravarty has read many books, hasn\'t he?\"</p>
<p>M: \"Yes, sir, he has read a great deal.\"</p>
<p>MASTER (smiling): \"I wish he and Girish could meet. Then we could enjoy
a little discussion.\"</p>
<p>GIRISH (smiling): \"Doesn\'t he say that by means of <em>sādhanā</em> all
people can be like Sri Krishna?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Not exactly that, but something like it.\"</p>
<p>DEVOTEE: \"Sir, can all be like Sri Krishna?\"</p>
<p><strong>Special traits of a Divine Incarnation</strong></p>
<p>MASTER: \"An Incarnation of God or one born with some of the
characteristics of an Incarnation is called an Isvarakoti. An ordinary
man is called a jiva or jivakoti. By dint of <em>sādhanā</em> a jivakoti can
realize God; but after samādhi he cannot come back to the plane of
relative consciousness.</p>
<p>\"The Isvarakoti is like the king\'s son. He has the keys to all the
rooms of the seven-storey palace; he can climb to all the seven floors
and come down at will. A jivakoti is like a petty officer. He can enter
some of the rooms of the palace; that is his limit.</p>
<p>\"Janaka was a Jnāni. He attained Knowledge by means of his <em>sādhanā</em>.
But Sukadeva was Knowledge itself.\"</p>
<p>GIRISH: \"Ah!\"</p>
<p><strong>Nārada and Sukadeva</strong></p>
<p>MASTER: \"Sukadeva did not attain Knowledge through <em>sādhanā</em>. Like
Sukadeva, Nārada also had the Knowledge of Brahman. But he retained
bhakti in order to teach people. Prahlada sometimes assumed the attitude
of \'I am He\', sometimes that of a servant of God, and sometimes that
of His child. Hanuman also was like that.</p>
<p>\"All may wish for such a lofty state, but all cannot attain it. Some
bamboos are hollower than others; some are more solid inside.\"</p>
<p>A DEVOTEE: \"You say that your spiritual experiences are for others to
refer to. Tell us what we should do.\"</p>
<p><strong>Master urges intense dispassion</strong></p>
<p>MASTER: \"If you want to realize God, then you must cultivate intense
dispassion. You must renounce</p>
<p>immediately what you feel to be standing in your way. You should not put
it off till the future. \'Woman and gold\' is the obstruction. The mind
must be withdrawn from it.</p>
<p>\"One must not be slow and lazy. A man was going to bathe; he had his
towel on his shoulder. His wife said to him: \'You are worthless. You
are getting old and still you cannot give up some of your habits. You
cannot live a single day without me. But look at that man! What a
renouncer he is!\'</p>
<p>\"HUSBAND: \'Why? What has he done?\'</p>
<p>\"WIFE: \'He has sixteen wives and he is renouncing them one by one. You
will never be able to renounce.\'</p>
<p>HUSBAND: \'Renouncing his wives one by one! You are crazy. He won\'t be
able to renounce. If a man wants to renounce, does he do it little by
little?\'</p>
<p>WIFE (smiling): \'Still he is better than you.\'</p>
<p>\"HUSBAND: \'You are silly; you don\'t understand. He cannot renounce.
But I can. See! Here I go!\' \"</p>
<p>The Master continued: \"That is called intense renunciation. No sooner
did the man discriminate than he renounced. He went away with the towel
on his shoulder. He didn\'t turn back to settle his worldly affairs. He
didn\'t even look back at his home.</p>
<p>\"He who wants to renounce needs great strength of mind. He must have a
dare-devil attitude like a dacoit\'s. Before looting a house, the
dacoits shout: \'Kill! Murder! Loot!\'</p>
<p>\"Cultivate devotion and love of God and so pass your days. What else
can you do? When Krishna went away, Yaśoda became insane with grief and
visited Radha. Radha was moved by her sorrow and appeared before her as
<em>Ādyāśakti</em>. She said, \'My child, ask a boon of Me.\' Yaśoda replied:
\'Mother, what else shall I ask of You? Bless me that I may serve
Krishna alone with my body, mind, and speech; that I may behold His
devotees with these eyes; that I may go with these feet to the place
where His divine sport is manifested; that I may serve Him and His
devotees with these hands; and that I may devote all my sense-organs to
His service alone.\' \"</p>
<p>As Sri Ramakrishna uttered these words, he was about to go into ecstasy.</p>
<p>Suddenly he exclaimed: \"Kāli, the Embodiment of Destruction! No,
Nityakali, my eternal Divine Mother\" With great difficulty he
restrained himself. He was starting to say more about Yaśoda, when
Mahendra Mukherji arrived.</p>
<p><strong>Advice to householders</strong></p>
<p>Mahendra and his younger brother, Priya, had been visiting the Master
for some time. Mahendra owned a flour-mill and other businesses. His
brother was an engineer. Both the brothers engaged people to manage
their affairs and therefore had considerable leisure. Mahendra was
thirty-six or thirty-seven and his brother two years younger. Besides
their country home at Kedeti, they had a house at Baghbazar, Calcutta. A
young devotee named Hari accompanied them on their visits to Sri
Ramakrishna. Hari was married but greatly devoted to the Master.
Mahendra and Hari had not visited Dakshineswar for a long time. They
saluted Sri Ramakrishna.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Hello! Why haven\'t you visited Dakshineswar for so long?\"</p>
<p>MAHENDRA: \"Sir, I have been away from Calcutta. I was at Kedeti.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"You have no children. You don\'t serve anybody. And still you
have no leisure! Goodness gracious!\"</p>
<p>The devotees remained silent. Mahendra was a little embarrassed.</p>
<p>MASTER (to Mahendra): \"Why am I saying all this to you? You are sincere
and generous. You have love for God.\"</p>
<p>MAHENDRA: \"You are saying these words for my good.\"</p>
<p>MASTER (smiling): \"You see, we don\'t take any collection during the
performance at our place. Jadu\'s mother says to me, \'Other sādhus
always ask for money, but you do not.\' Worldly people feel annoyed if
they have to spend money.</p>
<p>\"A theatrical performance was being given at a certain place. A man
felt a great desire to take a seat and see it. He peeped in and saw that
a collection was being taken from the audience. Quietly he slipped away.
Another performance was being given at some other place. He went there
and, inquiring, found that no collection would be taken. There was a
great rush of people. He elbowed his way through the crowd and reached
the center of the hall. There he picked out a nice seat for himself,
twirled his moustaches, and sat through the performance. (All laugh.)</p>
<p>\"You have no children to divert your mind. I know a deputy magistrate
who draws a salary of eight hundred rupees a month. He went to Keshab\'s
house to see a performance. I was there too. Rākhāl and a few other
devotees were with me and sat beside me. After a while Rākhāl went out
for a few minutes. The deputy magistrate came over and made his young
son take Rākhāl \'s seat. I said, \'He can\'t sit there.\' \'At that
time I was in such a state of mind that I had to do whatever the person
next to me would ask me to do; so I had seated Rākhāl beside me. As long
as the performance lasted the deputy did nothing but gibber with his
son. The rascal didn\'t look at the performance even once. I heard, too,
that he is a slave to his wife; he gets up and sits down as she tells
him to. And he didn\'t see the performance for that snub-nosed monkey of
a boy.</p>
<p>(To Mahendra) \"Do you practise meditation?\"</p>
<p>MAHENDRA: \"Yes, sir. A little.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Come to Dakshineswar now and then.\"</p>
<p>MAHENDRA (smiling): \"Yes, sir. I will. You know where my knots and
twists are. You will straighten them out.\"</p>
<p>MASTER (smiling): \"First come to Dakshineswar; then I shall press your
limbs to see where your twists are. Why don\'t you come?\"</p>
<p>MAHENDRA: \"Because of the pressure of my duties. Besides, I have to go
to my country home now and then.\"</p>
<p>MASTER (to Mahendra, pointing his finger at the devotees): \"Have they
no homes or dwelling-places? Have they no duties? How is it that they
come?</p>
<p>(To Hari) \"Why haven\'t you come to Dakshineswar? Is your wife living
with you?\"</p>
<p>HARI: \"No, sir.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Then why did you forget me?\"</p>
<p>HARI: \"I haven\'t been well, sir.\"</p>
<p>MASTER (to the devotees): \"He looks thin. He has no small measure of
bhakti. He is overflowing with it, but it is of a rather troublesome
nature.\" (Laughter.)</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna used to address a certain devotee\'s wife by the name of
\"Habi\'s mother\". Her brother, a college student aged about twenty,
was there. He stood up, ready to go and play cricket. His younger
brother,</p>
<p>named Dwija, was also a devotee of the Master. Both brothers left the
room. A few minutes later Dwija returned. The Master said, \"Why didn\'t
you go?\" A devotee answered: \"He wants to hear the music. Perhaps that
is why he has come back.\"</p>
<p>Trailokya, the Brahmo devotee, was to sing for the Master. Paltu
arrived. The Master said: \"Who is this? Ah! It is Paltu.\"</p>
<p>Purna, another young devotee, also arrived. It was with great difficulty
that Sri Ramakrishna had managed to have him come. His relatives
strongly objected to his visiting the Master. Purna was a student in the
fifth grade of the school where M. taught. The boy prostrated himself
before Sri Ramakrishna. The Master seated him by his side and was
talking to him in a low voice. M. alone was sitting near them. The other
devotees were talking about various things. Girish, sitting on the other
side of the room, was reading a life of Keshab.</p>
<p>MASTER (to Purna): \"Come nearer.\"</p>
<p>GIRISH(to M.): \"Who is this boy?\"</p>
<p>M. was afraid that others might notice the boy. This would make trouble
for him at home and M would be responsible for it.</p>
<p>M. (Sharply): \"Don\'t you see he is a boy?\"</p>
<p>GIRISH (smiling): \"I need no ghost to tell me that.\"</p>
<p>The Master and the boy were talking in low tones.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Do you practise what I asked you to?\"</p>
<p>PURNA: \"Yes, sir.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Do you dream? Do you dream of a flame? A lighted torch? A
married woman? A cremation ground? It is good to dream of these
things.\"</p>
<p>PURNA: \"I dreamt of you. You were seated and were telling me
something.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"What? Some instructions? Tell me some of it.\"</p>
<p>PURNA: \"I don\'t remember now.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Never mind. But it is very good. You will make progress. You
feel attracted to me, don\'t you?\"</p>
<p>A few minutes later Sri Ramakrishna said to the boy, \"Won\'t you come
there?\" He meant Dakshineswar. \"I can\'t promise\", answered the boy.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Why? Doesn\'t one of your relatives live there?\"</p>
<p>PURNA: \"Yes, sir. But it won\'t be very convenient for me to go.\"
Girish was reading a life of Keshab written by Trailokya of the Brahmo
Samaj. In it Trailokya said that at first Sri Ramakrishna had been very
much opposed to the world but that after meeting Keshab he had changed
his mind and had come to believe that, one could lead a spiritual life
in the world as well. Several devotees had told the Master about this.
They wanted to discuss it with Trailokya. Those passages in the book had
been read to the Master.</p>
<p>Noticing the book in Girish\'s hand, Sri Ramakrishna said to Girish, M.,
Ram, and the other devotees: \"Those people are busy with the world.
That is why they set such a high value on worldly life. They are drowned
in \'woman and gold\'. One doesn\'t talk that way after realizing God.
After enjoying divine bliss, one looks on the world as crow-droppings.
At the very outset I utterly renounced everything. Not only did I
renounce the</p>
<p>company of worldly people, but now and then the company of devotees as
well. I noticed that the devotees were dropping dead one by one, and
that made my heart writhe with pain. But now I keep one or two of them
with me.\"</p>
<p>Girish left for home, saying he would come back. Trailokya arrived with
Jaygopal Sen. They bowed before the Master and sat down. He inquired
about their health. The younger Naren entered the room and saluted Sri
Ramakrishna. The Master said to him, \"Why didn\'t you see me last
Saturday?\"</p>
<p>Trailokya was ready to sing.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Ah! You sang that day about the Blissful Mother. How sweetly
you sang! Others\' songs seem insipid to me. That day I didn\'t enjoy
even Narendra\'s singing. Why don\'t you sing those same songs again?\"
Trailokya sang:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Victory to Gora, Sachi\'s son!</em></p>
<p><em>Hail, Abode of every virtue,</em></p>
<p><em>Touchstone of Love, Ocean of Bliss,</em></p>
<p><em>Man\'s bewitcher, beauteous of form,</em></p>
<p><em>Enchanting the eye like shining gold!</em></p>
<p><em>His tender arms that reach to the knee,</em></p>
<p><em>Graceful and long as lotus stalks,</em></p>
<p><em>Are lovingly stretched to all mankind,</em></p>
<p><em>His lotus face of matchless beauty</em></p>
<p><em>Overflows with the nectar of Love;</em></p>
<p><em>His cheeks are covered with curling hair!</em></p>
<p><em>Alight with heavenly love, his beauty</em></p>
<p><em>Charms the eye! Beaming with fervour,</em></p>
<p><em>Radiant with Bliss, his body trembling</em></p>
<p><em>With Hari\'s joy, Gaurānga the golden</em></p>
<p><em>Dances like a mad elephant, shaking</em></p>
<p><em>In all his limbs with the frenzy of love!</em></p>
<p><em>Gaurānga, singer of Hari\'s glories,</em></p>
<p><em>Prize of every sādhu\'s heart,</em></p>
<p><em>Rarest of men, the Ocean of Love,</em></p>
<p><em>Embraces the outcaste, calls him brother,</em></p>
<p><em>Takes him in his arms in fervent love!</em></p>
<p><em>He dances with both his arms upraised,</em></p>
<p><em>And sings Hari\'s name; the tears are streaming</em></p>
<p><em>Down his cheeks; he weeps, he cries,</em></p>
<p><em>He trembles, roars, and rages, saying,</em></p>
<p><em>\"Where is Hari, the Jewel of my heart?\"</em></p>
<p><em>The hair on his limbs is standing on end,</em></p>
<p><em>Like a kadamba flower is his body,</em></p>
<p><em>Covered with dust he rolls on the ground.</em></p>
<p><em>O Thou, the Abode of Hari\'s lila,</em></p>
<p><em>Fountain-head of Love\'s elixir,</em></p>
<p><em>Friend of the helpless, Glory of Banga,</em></p>
<p><em>Hail Chaitanya, Thou who shinest</em></p>
<p><em>Bright as the moon, in the bhakta\'s heart!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna left the room for a minute. The women devotees were
seated near the screen. They were eager to see Sri Ramakrishna.
Trailokya went on with his music.</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna entered the room again and said to Trailokya, \"Please
sing a little about the Blissful Mother.\"</p>
<p>Trailokya sang:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>O Mother, how deep is Thy love for men!</em></p>
<p><em>Mindful of it, I weep for joy. . . .</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Listening to the song, the younger Naren went into deep meditation. He
remained as still as a log. Sri Ramakrishna said to M.: \"Look at him.
He is totally unaware of the outer world.\" The song was over. At Sri
Ramakrishna\'s request, Trailokya sang:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>O Mother, make me mad with Thy love!</em></p>
<p><em>What need have I of knowledge or reason? . . .</em></p>
<p><em>Ram asked him to sing about Hari.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Trailokya sang:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Chant, O mind, the name of Hari,</em></p>
<p><em>Sing aloud the name of Hari,</em></p>
<p><em>Praise Lord Hari\'s name!</em></p>
<p><em>And praising Hari\'s name, O mind,</em></p>
<p><em>Cross the ocean of this world.</em></p>
<p><em>Hari dwells in earth, in water,</em></p>
<p><em>Hari dwells in fire and air;</em></p>
<p><em>In sun and moon He dwells.</em></p>
<p><em>Hari\'s ever living presence</em></p>
<p><em>Fills the boundless universe.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>M. said in a low voice to Trailokya, \"Please- \'Gaur and Nitai, ye
blessed brothers\'.\"</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna, too, asked him to sing the song. Trailokya and the
devotees sang it in chorus, the Master joining them. When it was over,
the Master sang:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Behold, the two brothers have come, who weep while chanting Hari\'s
name,</em></p>
<p><em>The brothers who, in return for blows, offer to sinners Hari\'s
love,</em></p>
<p><em>Embracing everyone as brother, even the outcaste shunned by men.</em></p>
<p><em>Behold, the two brothers have come, who once were Kanai and Balāi of
Braja. . . .</em></p>
<p><em>Sri Ramakrishna sang again:</em></p>
<p><em>See how all Nadia is shaking</em></p>
<p><em>Under the waves of Gaurānga\'s love! . . .</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Who are they that walk along, chanting Hari\'s name?</em></p>
<p><em>O Madhai, go out and see!</em></p>
<p><em>They seem to be Gaur and Nitai,</em></p>
<p><em>With golden anklets on their lovely feet;</em></p>
<p><em>Shaven of head and clad in rags,</em></p>
<p><em>They reel like madmen as they go. . . .</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The younger Naren was about to leave.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Show great devotion to your parents; but don\'t obey them if
they stand in your way to God. You</p>
<p>must gird your loins with great determination and say, \'This rogue of a
father!\'\"</p>
<p>NAREN: \"Truly, I have no fear.\"</p>
<p>Girish arrived. Sri Ramakrishna introduced him to Trailokya. He asked
them to talk to each other. A few minutes later the Master said, \"That
song again, please.\"</p>
<p>Trailokya sang:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Victory to Gora, Sachi\'s son!</em></p>
<p><em>Hail, Abode of every virtue,</em></p>
<p><em>Touchstone of Love, Ocean of Bliss,</em></p>
<p><em>Man\'s bewitcher, beauteous of form,</em></p>
<p><em>Enchanting the eye like shining gold! . . .</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna went into samādhi. He stood up, totally unconscious of
the world.</p>
<p>Regaining partial consciousness, he begged Trailokya to sing \"Oh, what
a vision I have beheld\".</p>
<p>Trailokya sang:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Oh, what a vision I have beheld in Keshab Bharati\'s hut!</em></p>
<p><em>Gora, in all his matchless grace</em></p>
<p><em>Shedding tears in a thousand streams!</em></p>
<p><em>Like a mad elephant</em></p>
<p><em>He dances in ecstasy and sings,</em></p>
<p><em>Drunk with an overwhelming love.</em></p>
<p><em>Rolling flat upon the ground and swimming in his tears,</em></p>
<p><em>He weeps and shouts Lord Hari\'s name,</em></p>
<p><em>Piercing the very heavens with his cries,</em></p>
<p><em>Loud as a lion\'s roar;</em></p>
<p><em>Then most humbly he begs men\'s love,</em></p>
<p><em>To feel himself the servant of God.</em></p>
<p><em>Shorn of his locks, he has put on the yogi\'s ochre robe;</em></p>
<p><em>Even the hardest heart must melt</em></p>
<p><em>To see his pure and heavenly love.</em></p>
<p><em>Smitten with man\'s deep woe,</em></p>
<p><em>He has abandoned everything</em></p>
<p><em>And pours out love unstintingly.</em></p>
<p><em>Oh, would that Premdas were his slave and, passing from door to door,
Might sing Gaurānga\'s endless praise!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The music was over. It was about dusk. Sri Ramakrishna was surrounded by
the devotees.</p>
<p>MASTER (to Ram): \"There were no instruments to accompany the songs. The
singing creates an atmosphere when there is proper accompaniment.
(Smiling) Do you know how Balarām manages a festival? He is like a
miserly brahmin raising a cow. The cow must eat very little but give
milk in torrents. (All laugh.) Sing your own songs and beat your own
drums: that\'s Balarām\'s idea!\" (All laugh.)</p>
<p><strong>Discussion with Trailokya</strong></p>
<p>As evening came on, lamps were lighted in the drawing-room and on the
verandah. Sri Ramakrishna bowed to the Divine Mother and began to chant
the name of God. The devotees sat around and listened to his sweet
chanting. They wanted to discuss with Trailokya his remarks about the
Master\'s change of opinion on worldly life. Girish started the
discussion.</p>
<p>GIRISH (to Trailokya): \"You have written that, after coming in contact
with Keshab, Sri Ramakrishna changed his views about worldly life; but
it isn\'t true.\"</p>
<p>MASTER (to Trailokya and the other devotees): \"If a man enjoys the
Bliss of God, he doesn\'t enjoy the world. Having tasted divine bliss,
he finds the world insipid. If a man gets a shawl, he doesn\'t care for
broadcloth.\"</p>
<p>TRAILOKYA: \"I referred to those who wanted to lead a worldly life. I
didn\'t mean renouncers\"</p>
<p><strong>Divine bliss is the highest</strong></p>
<p>MASTER: \"What are you talking about? People talk about leading a
religious life in the world. But if they once taste the bliss of God
they will not enjoy anything else. Their attachment to worldly duties
declines. As their spiritual joy becomes deeper, they simply cannot
perform their worldly duties. More and more they seek that joy. Can
worldly pleasures and sex pleasures be compared to the bliss of God? If
a man once tastes that bliss he runs after it ever afterwards. It
matters very little to him then whether the world remains or disappears.</p>
<p>\"Though the chatak bird is about to die of a parched throat, and around
it there are seven oceans, rivers, and lakes overflowing with water,
still it will not touch that water. Its throat is cracking with thirst,
and still it will not drink that water. It looks up, mouth agape, for
the rain to fall when the star Svati is in the ascendant. \'To the
chatak bird all waters are mere dryness beside Swati water.\'</p>
<p><strong>Holding to both God and the world</strong></p>
<p>\"People say they will hold to both God and the world. After drinking an
ounce of wine, a man may be pleasantly intoxicated and also conscious of
the world; but can he be both when he has drunk a great deal more?\"</p>
<p>After the bliss of God nothing else tastes good. Then talk about \'woman
and gold\' stabs the heart, as it were. (Intoning) \'I cannot enjoy the
talk of worldly people.\' When a man becomes mad for God, he doesn\'t
enjoy money or such things.\"</p>
<p>TRAILOKYA: \"But, sir, if a man is to remain in the world, he needs
money and he must also save. He has to give in charity and-\"</p>
<p><strong>Worldly man\'s charity</strong></p>
<p>MASTER: \"What? Do you mean that one must first save money and then seek
God? And you talk about charity and kindness! A worldly man spends
thousands of rupees for his daughter\'s marriage. Yet, all the while,
his neighbours are dying of starvation; and he finds it hard to give
them two morsels of rice; he calculates a thousand times before giving
them even that much. The People around him have nothing to eat; but what
does he care about that? He says to himself: \'What can I do? Let the
rascals live or die. All I care about is that the members of my family
should live well.\' And they talk about doing good to others!\"</p>
<p>TRAILOKYA: \"But, sir, there are good people in the world as well. Take
the case of Pundarika Vidyanidhi, the devotee of Chaitanya. He lived in
the world.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"He had drunk wine up to his neck. If he had drunk a little
more, he couldn\'t have led a worldly life.\"</p>
<p>Trailokya remained silent. M said aside to Girish, \'Then what he has
written is not true.\"</p>
<p>GIRISH (to Trailokya): \"Then what you have written is not true.\"</p>
<p>TRAILOKYA: \"Why so? Doesn\'t he [meaning Sri Ramakrishna] admit that
a man can lead a spiritual life in the world?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Yes, he can. But such a man should first of all attain
Knowledge and then live in the world. First he should realize God. Then
\'he can swim in a sea of slander and not be stained.\' After realizing
God, a man can</p>
<p>live in the world like a mudfish. The world he lives in after attaining
God is the world of vidyā. In it he sees neither woman nor gold. He
finds there only devotion, devotee, and God. You see, I too have a wife,
and \'a few pots and pans in my room; I too feed a few vagabonds; I too
worry about the devotees-Habi\'s mother for instance-when they come
here.\"</p>
<p>A DEVOTEE (to Trailokya): \"I have read in your book that you do not
believe in the Incarnation of God. You said so in connection with
Chaitanya.\"</p>
<p>TRAlLOKYA: \"Why, Chaitanya himself protested against the idea of Divine
Incarnation. Once, in Puri, Advaita and the other devotees sang a song
to the effect that Chaitanya was God. At this Chaitanya shut the door of
his room. Infinite are the glories of God. As he [meaning Sri
Ramakrishna] says, the devotee is the parlour of God. Suppose a parlour
is very well furnished; does that mean that the master of the house has
exhausted all his power and splendour in that one parlour?\"</p>
<p>GIRISH: \"He [meaning Sri Ramakrishna] says that prema alone is the
essence of God; we need the man through whom this ecstatic love of God
flows. He says that the milk of the cow flows through the udder; we need
the udder; we do not care for the other parts of the cow-the legs, tail,
or horns.\"</p>
<p>TRAILOKYA: \"The milk of God\'s prema flows through an infinite number
of channels. God has infinite powers.\"</p>
<p>GIRISH: \"But what other power can stand before prema?\"</p>
<p>TRAILOKYA: \"It is possible if He who has the power wants it. Everything
is in God\'s power.\"</p>
<p>GIRISH: \"Yes, I admit that. But there is also a thing called the power
of avidyā.\"</p>
<p>TRAILOKYA: \"Is avidyā a thing? Does there exist a substance called
avidyā? It is only a negation, as darkness is the negation of light.
There is no doubt that we prize prema most: what is a drop to God is an
ocean to us. But if you say that prema is the last word about God, then
you limit God Himself.\"</p>
<p>MASTER (to Trailokya and the other devotees): \"Yes, yes, that is true.
But an ounce of wine makes me drunk. What need have I to count the
gallons of wine in the tavern? What need have we to know about the
infinite powers of God?\"</p>
<p>GIRISH (to Trailokya): \"Do you believe in the Incarnation of God?\"</p>
<p>TRAILOKYA: \"God incarnates Himself through His devotees alone. There
cannot be a manifestation of infinite powers. It simply isn\'t possible.
It is impossible for any man to manifest infinite powers.\"</p>
<p>GIRISH: \"You can serve your children as \'Brahma Gopala\'. Then why
isn\'t it possible to worship a great soul as God?\"</p>
<p>MASTER (to Trailokya): \"Why all this bother about infinity? If I want
to touch you, must I touch your entire body? If you want to bathe in the
Ganges, must you touch the whole river from Hardwar down to the ocean?</p>
<ol>
<li>\'All troubles come to an end when the ego dies.\' As long as a
    trace of \'I-consciousness\' remains, one is conscious of
    difference. Nobody knows what remains after the \'I\' disappears.
    Nobody can express it in words. That which is remains. After the
    \'I\' disappears one cannot say that a part manifests through this
    man and the rest through another. Satchidananda is the ocean. The
    pot of \'I\' is immersed in it. As long as the pot exists, the water
    seems to be divided into two parts: one part inside the pot and the
    other part outside it. But when the pot is broken there is only one
    stretch of water. One cannot even say that. Who would say that?\"</li>
</ol>
<p>After the discussion Sri Ramakrishna became engaged in pleasant
conversation with Trailokya.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"You are happy. Isn\'t that so?\"</p>
<p>TRAILOKYA: \"But I shall become my old self again as soon as I leave
this place. Here I feel very much the awakening of spiritual
consciousness.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"You don\'t have to be afraid of walking on thorns if you are
wearing shoes. You needn\'t be afraid of \'woman and gold\' if you know
that God alone is real and all else illusory.\"</p>
<p>It was about nine o\'clock in the evening. Balarām took Trailokya to
another room and gave him refreshments.</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna began to tell the devotees about Trailokya and people of
his views.</p>
<p>MASTER (to Girish, M., and the other devotees): \"Do you know what these
people are like? They are like a frog living in a well, who has never
seen the outside world. He knows only his well; so he will not believe
that there is such a thing as the world. Likewise, people talk so much
about the world because they have not known the joy or God.</p>
<p>(To Girish) \"Why do you argue with them so much? They busy themselves
with both-the world and God. One cannot understand the joy of God unless
one has tasted it. Can anybody explain sex pleasure to a five-year-old
boy? Worldly people talk about God only from hearsay. Children, hearing
their old aunts quarrelling among themselves, learn to say, \'There is
my God\', \'I swear by God.\'</p>
<p>\"But that doesn\'t matter. I don\'t blame such people. Can all
comprehend the Indivisible Satchidananda? Only twelve rishis could
recognize Ramachandra. All cannot recognize an Incarnation of God. Some
take him for an ordinary man, some for a holy person, and only a few
recognize him as an Incarnation.</p>
<p>\"One offers a price for an article according to one\'s capital. A rich
man said to his servant: \'Take this diamond to the market and let me
know how different people price it. Take it, first of all, to the
egg-plant seller.\' The servant took the diamond to the egg-plant
seller. He examined it, turning it over in the palm of his hand, and
said, \'Brother, I can give nine seers of egg-plants for it.\'
\'Friend,\' said the servant, \'a little more-say, ten seers.\' The
egg-plant seller replied: \'No, I have already quoted above the market
price. You may give it to me if that price suits you.\' The servant
laughed. He went back to his master and said: \'Sir, he would give me
only nine seers of egg-plants and not one more. He said he had offered
more than the market price.\' The master smiled and said: \'Now take it
to the cloth-dealer. The other man deals only in egg-plants. What does
he know about a diamond? The cloth-dealer has a little more capital. Let
us see how much he offers for it.\' The servant went to the cloth-dealer
and said: \'Will you buy this? How much will you pay for it?\' The
merchant said: \'Yes, it is a good thing. I can make a nice ornament out
of it. I will give you nine hundred rupees for it.\' \'Brother,\' said
the servant, \'offer a little more and I will sell it to you. Give me at
least a thousand rupees.\' The cloth-dealer said: \'Friend, don\'t press
me for more. I have offered more than the market price. I cannot give a
rupee more. Suit yourself.\' Laughing the servant returned to his master
and said: \'He won\'t give a rupee more than nine hundred. He too said
he had quoted above the market price.\' The master said with a laugh:
\'Now take it to a jeweller. Let us see what he has to say.\' The
servant went to a jeweller. The jeweller glanced at the diamond and said
at once, \'I will give you one hundred thousand rupees for it.\'</p>
<p>\"They talk of practising religion in the world. Suppose a man is shut
up in a room. All the doors and windows are closed. Only a little light
comes through a hole in the ceiling. Can he see the sun with that roof
over his head? And what will he do with only one ray of light? \'Woman
and gold\' is the roof. Can he see the sun unless he removes the roof?
Worldly people are shut up in a room, as it were.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion about Divine Incarnations</strong></p>
<p>\"The Incarnations of God belong to the class of the Isvarakotis. They
roam about in the open spaces. They are never imprisoned in the world,
never entangled by it. Their ego is not the \'thick ego\' of worldly
people. The ego, the \'I-consciousness\', of worldly people is like four
walls and a roof: the man inside them cannot see anything outside. The
ego of the Incarnations and other Isvarakotis is a \'thin ego\': through
it they have an uninterrupted vision of God. Take the case of a man who
stands by a wall on both sides of which there are meadows stretching to
infinity. If there is a hole in the wall, through it he can see
everything on the other</p>
<p>side. If the hole is a big one, he can even pass through it. The ego of
the Incarnations and other Isvarakotis is like the wall with a hole.
Though they remain on this side of the wall, still they can see the
endless meadow on the other side. That is to say, though they have a
human body, they are always united with God. Again, if they will, they
can pass through the big hole to the other side and remain in samādhi.
And if the hole is big enough, they can go through it and come back
again. That is to say, though established in samādhi, they can again
descend to the worldly plane.\"</p>
<p>The devotees listened breathlessly to these words about the mystery of
Divine Incarnation.</p>
