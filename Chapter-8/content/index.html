<p>THE MASTER AND VIJAY GOSWAMI</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thursday, December 14, 1882</p>
</blockquote>
<p>IT WAS AFTERNOON. Sri Ramakrishna was sitting on his bed after a short
noonday rest. Vijay, Balaram, M., and a few other devotees were sitting
on the floor with their faces toward the Master. They could see the
sacred river Ganges through the door. Since it was winter all were
wrapped up in warm clothes. Vijay had been suffering from colic and had
brought some medicine with him.</p>
<p><strong>Vijay, the Brahmo preacher</strong></p>
<p>Vijay was a paid preacher in the Sadharan Brahmo Samaj, but there were
many things about which he could not agree with the Samaj authorities.
He came from a very noble family of Bengal noted for its piety and other
spiritual qualities. Advaita Goswami, one of his remote ancestors, had
been an intimate companion of Sri Chaitanya. Thus the blood of a great
lover of God flowed in Vijay\'s veins. As an adherent of the Brahmo
Samaj, Vijay no doubt meditated on the formless Brahman; but his innate
love of God, inherited from his distinguished ancestors, had merely been
waiting for the proper time to manifest itself in all its sweetness.
Thus Vijay was irresistibly attracted by the God-intoxicated state of
Sri Ramakrishna and often sought his company. He would listen to the
Master\'s words with great respect, and they would dance together in an
ecstasy of divine love.</p>
<p>It was a week-day. Generally devotees came to the Master in large
numbers on Sundays; hence those who wanted to have intimate talks with
him visited him on week-days.</p>
<p><strong>Tendencies from previous births</strong></p>
<p>A boy named Vishnu, living in Ariadaha, had recently committed suicide
by cutting his throat with a razor. The talk turned to him.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"I felt very badly when I heard of the boy\'s passing away. He
was a pupil in a school and he used to come here. He would often say to
me that he couldn\'t enjoy worldly life. He had lived with some
relatives in the western provinces and at that time used to meditate in
solitude, in the meadows, hills, and forests. He told me he had visions
of many divine forms.</p>
<p>\"Perhaps this was his last birth. He must have finished most of his
duties in his previous birth. The little that had been left undone was
perhaps finished in this one.</p>
<p>\"One must admit the existence of tendencies inherited from previous
births. There is a story about a man who practised the sava-sadhana.l He
worshipped the Divine Mother in a deep forest. First he saw many
terrible visions. Finally a tiger attacked and killed him. Another man,
happening to pass and seeing the approach of the tiger, had climbed a
tree. Afterwards he got down and found all the arrangements for worship
at hand. He performed some purifying ceremonies and seated himself on
the corpse. No sooner had he done a little japa than the Divine Mother
appeared before him and said: \'My child, I am very much pleased with
you. Accept a boon from Me.\' He bowed low at the Lotus Feet of the
Goddess and said: \'May I ask You one question, Mother? I am speechless
with amazement at Your action. The other man worked so hard to get the
ingredients for Your worship and tried to propitiate You for such a long
time, but You didn\'t condescend to show him Your favour. And I, who
don\'t know anything of worship, who have done nothing, who have neither
devotion nor knowledge nor love, and who haven\'t practised any
austerities, am receiving so much of Your grace.\' The Divine Mother
said with a laugh: \'My child, you don\'t remember your previous births.
For many births you tried to propitiate Me through austerities. As a
result of those austerities all these things have come to hand, and you
have been blessed with My Vision. Now ask Me your boon.\' \"</p>
<p><strong>Suicide after the vision of God</strong></p>
<p>A DEVOTEE: \"I am frightened to hear of the suicide.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Suicide is a heinous sin, undoubtedly. A man who kills himself
must return again and again to this world and suffer its agony.</p>
<p>\"But I don\'t call it suicide if a person leaves his body after having
the vision of God. There is no harm in giving up one\'s body that way.
After attaining Knowledge some people give up their bodies. After the
gold image has been cast in the clay mould, you may either preserve the
mould or break it.</p>
<p>\"Many years ago a young man of about twenty used to come to the temple
garden from Baranagore; his name was Gopal Sen. In my presence he used
to experience such intense ecstasy that Hriday had to support him for
fear he might fall to the ground and break his limbs. That young man
touched my feet one day and said: \'Sir, I shall not be able to see you
any more. Let me bid you good-bye.\' A few days later I learnt that he
had given up his body.</p>
<p><strong>Four classes of men</strong></p>
<p>\"It is said that there are four classes of human beings: the bound,
those aspiring after liberation, the liberated, and the ever-perfect.</p>
<p><strong>Parable of the fish and the net</strong></p>
<p>\"This world is like a fishing-net. Men are the fish, and God, whose
maya has created this world, is the fisherman. When the fish are
entangled in the net, some of them try to tear through its meshes in
order to get their liberation. They are like the men striving after
liberation. But by no means all of them escape. Only a few jump out of
the net with a loud splash, and then people say, \'Ah! There goes a big
one!\' In like manner, three or four men attain liberation. Again, some
fish are so careful by nature that they are never caught in the net;
some beings of the ever-perfect class, like Narada, are never entangled
in the meshes of worldliness. Most of the fish are trapped; but they are
not conscious of the net and of their imminent death. No sooner are they
entangled than they run headlong, net and all, trying to hide themselves
in the mud. They don\'t make the least effort to get free. On the
contrary, they go deeper and deeper into the mud. These fish are like
the bound men. They are still inside the net, but they think they are
quite safe there. A bound creature is immersed in worldliness, in
\'woman and gold\', having gone deep into the mire of degradation. But
still he believes he is quite happy and secure. The liberated, and the
seekers after liberation, look on the world as a deep well. They do not
enjoy it. Therefore, after the attainment of Knowledge, the realization
of God, some give up their bodies. But such a thing is rare indeed.</p>
<p><strong>Worldly-minded forget their lessons</strong></p>
<p>\"The bound creatures, entangled in worldliness, will not come to their
senses at all. They suffer so much misery and agony, they face so many
dangers, and yet they will not wake up.</p>
<p>\"The camel loves to eat thorny bushes. The more it eats the thorns, the
more the blood gushes from its mouth. Still it must eat thorny plants
and will never give them up. The man of worldly nature suffers so much
sorrow and affliction, but he forgets it all in a few days and begins
his old life over again. Suppose a man has lost his wife or she has
turned unfaithful. Lo! He marries again.</p>
<p>\"Or take the instance of a mother: her son dies and she suffers bitter
grief; but after a few days she forgets all about it. The mother, so
overwhelmed with sorrow a few days before, now attends to her toilet and
puts on her jewelry. A father becomes bankrupt through the marriage of
his daughters, yet he goes on having children year after year. People
are ruined by litigation, yet they go to court all the same. There are
men who cannot feed the children they have, who cannot clothe them or
provide decent shelter for them; yet they have more children every year.</p>
<p>\"Again, the worldly man is like a snake trying to swallow a mole. The
snake can neither swallow the mole nor</p>
<p>give it up. The bound soul may have realized that there is no substance
to the world-that the world is like a hog plum, only stone and skin-but
still he cannot give it up and turn his mind to God.</p>
<p>\"I once met a relative of Keshab Sen, fifty years old. He was playing
cards. As if the time had not yet come for him to think of God!</p>
<p>\"There is another characteristic of the bound soul. If you remove him
from his worldly surroundings to a spiritual environment, he will pine
away. The worm that grows in filth feels very happy there. It thrives in
filth. It will die if you put it in a pot of rice.\"</p>
<p>All remained silent.</p>
<p><strong>Bondage removed by strong renunciation</strong></p>
<p>VIJAY: \"What must the bound soul\'s condition of mind be in order to
achieve liberation?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"He can free himself from attachment to \'woman and gold\' if,
by the grace of God, he cultivates a spirit of strong renunciation. What
is this strong renunciation? One who has only a mild spirit of
renunciation says, \'Well, all will happen in the course of time; let me
now simply repeat the name of God.\' But a man possessed of a strong
spirit of renunciation feels restless for God, as the mother feels for
her own child. A man of strong renunciation seeks nothing but God. He
regards the world as a deep well and feels as if he were going to be
drowned in it. He looks on his relatives as venomous snakes; he wants to
fly away from them. And he does go away. He never thinks, \'Let me first
make some arrangement for my family and then I shall think of God.\' He
has great inward resolution.</p>
<p><strong>Parable of the two farmers</strong></p>
<p>\"Let me tell you a story about strong renunciation. At one time there
was a drought in a certain part of the country. The farmers began to cut
long channels to bring water to their fields. One farmer was stubbornly
determined. He took a vow that he would not stop digging until the
channel connected his field with the river. He set to work. The time
came for his bath, and his wife sent their daughter to him with oil.
\'Father,\' said the girl, \'it is already late. Rub your body with oil
and take your bath.\' \'Go away!\' thundered the farmer. \'I have too
much to do now.\' It was past midday, and the farmer was still at work
in his field. He didn\'t even think of his bath. Then his wife came and
said: \'Why haven\'t you taken your bath? The food is getting cold. You
overdo everything. You can finish the rest tomorrow or even today after
dinner.\' The farmer scolded her furiously and ran at her, spade in
hand, crying: \'What? Have you no sense? There\'s no rain. The crops are
dying. What will the children eat? You\'ll all starve to death. I have
taken a vow not to think of bath and food today before I bring water to
my field.\' The wife saw his state of mind and ran away in fear. Through
a whole day\'s back-breaking labour the farmer managed by evening to
connect his field with the river. Then he sat down and watched the water
flowing into his field with a murmuring sound. His mind was filled with
peace and joy. He went home, called his wife, and said to her, \'Now
give me some oil and prepare me a smoke.\' With serene mind he finished
his bath and meal, and retired to bed, where he snored to his heart\'s
content. The determination he showed is an example of strong
renunciation.</p>
<p>\"Now, there was another farmer who was also digging a channel to bring
water to his field. His wife, too, came to the field and said to him:
\'It\'s very late. Come home. It isn\'t necessary to overdo things.\'
The farmer didn\'t protest much, but put aside his spade and said to his
wife, \'Well, I\'ll go home since you ask me to.\' (All laugh) That man
never succeeded in irrigating his field. This is a case of mild
renunciation.</p>
<p>\"As without strong determination the farmer cannot bring water to his
field, so also without intense yearning a man cannot realize God. (To
Vijay) Why don\'t you come here now as frequently as before?\"</p>
<p>VIJAY: \"Sir, I wish to very much, but I am not free. I have accepted
work in the Brahmo Samaj.\"</p>
<p><strong>Attachment to \"woman\" creates bondage</strong></p>
<p>MASTER: \"It is \'woman and gold\' that binds man and robs him of his
freedom. It is woman that creates the</p>
<p>need for gold. For woman one man becomes the slave of another, and so
loses his freedom. Then he cannot act as he likes.</p>
<p><strong>Story of Govindaji\'s priests</strong></p>
<p>\"The priests in the temple of Govindaji at Jaipur were celibates at
first, and at that time they had fiery natures. Once the King of Jaipur
sent for them, but they didn\'t obey him. They said to the messenger,
\'Ask the king to come to see us.\' After consultation, the king and his
ministers arranged marriages for them. From then on the king didn\'t
have to send for them. They would come to him of themselves and say:
\'Your Majesty, we have come with our blessings. Here are the sacred
flowers of the temple. Deign to accept them.\' They came to the palace,
for now they always wanted money for one thing or another: the building
of a house, the rice-taking ceremony of their babies, or the rituals
connected with the beginning of their children\'s education.</p>
<p><strong>Story of twelve hundred nedas</strong></p>
<p>\"There is the story of the twelve hundred nedas and thirteen hundred
nedis. Virabhadra, the son of Nityananda Goswami, had thirteen hundred
\'shaven-headed\' disciples. They attained great spiritual powers. That
alarmed their teacher. \'My disciples have acquired great spiritual
powers\', thought Virabhadra. \'Whatever they say to people will come to
pass. Wherever they go they may create alarming situations; for people
offending them unwittingly will come to grief.\' Thinking thus,
Virabhadra one day called them to him and said, \'See me after
performing your daily devotions on the bank of the Ganges.\' These
disciples had such a high spiritual nature that, while meditating, they
would go into samādhi and be unaware of the river water flowing over
their heads during the flood-tide. Then the ebb-tide would come and
still they would remain absorbed in meditation.</p>
<p>\"Now, one hundred of these disciples had anticipated what their teacher
would ask of them. Lest they should have to disobey his injunctions,
they had quickly disappeared from the place before he summoned them. So
they did not go to Virabhadra with the others. The remaining twelve
hundred disciples went to the teacher after finishing their meditation.
Virabhadra said to them: \'These thirteen hundred nuns will serve you. I
ask you to marry them.\' \'As you please, revered sir\', they said.
\'But one hundred of us have gone away.\' Thenceforth each of these
twelve hundred disciples had a wife. Consequently they all lost their
spiritual power. Their austerities did not have their original fire. The
company of woman robbed them of their spirituality because it destroyed
their freedom.</p>
<p><strong>Degrading effect of serving others</strong></p>
<p>(To Vijay) \"You yourself perceive how far you have gone down by being a
servant of others. Again, one finds that people with many university
degrees, scholars with their vast English education, accept service
under their English masters and are daily trampled under their boots.
The one cause of all this is woman. They have married and set up a \'gay
fair\' with their wives and children. Now they cannot go back, much as
they would like to. Hence all these insults and humiliations, all this
suffering from slavery.</p>
<p>\"Once a man realizes God through intense dispassion, he is no longer
attached to woman. Even if he must lead the life of a householder, he is
free from fear of and attachment to woman. Suppose there are two
magnets, one big and the other small. Which one will attract the iron?
The big one, of course. God is the big magnet. Compared to Him, woman is
a small one. What can \'woman\' do?\"</p>
<p><strong>Worshipping woman as Divine Mother</strong></p>
<p>A DEVOTEE: \"Sir, shall we hate women then?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"He who has realized God does not look upon a woman with the
eye of lust; so he is not afraid of her. He perceives clearly that women
are but so many aspects of the Divine Mother. He worships them all as
the Mother Herself.</p>
<p>(To Vijay) \"Come here now and then. I like to see you very much.\"</p>
<p>VIJAY: \"I have to do my various duties in the Brahmo Samaj; that is why
I can\'t always come here. But I shall visit you whenever I find it
possible.\"</p>
<p><strong>Difficulties of preaching</strong></p>
<p>MASTER (to Vijay): \"The task of a religious teacher is indeed
difficult. One cannot teach men without a direct command from God.
People won\'t listen to you if you teach without such authority. Such
teaching has no force behind it. One must first of all attain God
through spiritual discipline or some other means. Thus armed with
authority from God, one can deliver lectures.</p>
<p>\"After receiving the command from God, one can be a teacher and give
lectures anywhere. He who receives authority from God also receives
power from Him. Only then can he perform the difficult task of a
teacher.</p>
<p>\"An insignificant tenant was once engaged in a lawsuit with a big
landlord. People realized that there was a powerful man behind the
tenant. Perhaps another big landlord was directing the case from behind.
Man is an insignificant creature. He cannot fulfil the difficult task of
a teacher without receiving power direct from God.\"</p>
<p>VIJAY: \"Don\'t the teachings of the Brahmo Samaj bring men salvation?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"How is it ever possible for one man to liberate another from
the bondage of the world? God alone, the Creator of this
world-bewitching maya, can save men from maya. There is no other refuge
but that great Teacher, Satchidananda. How is it ever possible for men
who have not realized God or received His command, and who are not
strengthened with divine strength, to save others from the prison-house
of the world?</p>
<p>\"One day as I was passing the Panchavati on my way to the pine-grove, I
heard a bullfrog croaking. I thought it must have been seized by a
snake. After some time, as I was coming back, I could still hear its
terrified croaking. I looked to see what was the matter, and found that
a water-snake had seized it. The snake could neither swallow it nor give
it up. So there was no end to the frog\'s suffering. I thought that had
it been seized by a cobra it would have been silenced after three croaks
at the most. As it was only a water-snake, both of them had to go
through this agony. A man\'s ego is destroyed after three croaks, as it
were, if he gets into the clutches of a real teacher. But if the teacher
is an \'unripe\' one, then both the teacher and the disciple undergo
endless suffering. The disciple cannot get rid either of his ego or of
the shackles of the world. If a disciple falls into the clutches of an
incompetent teacher, he doesn\'t attain liberation.\"</p>
<p><strong>Ego alone the cause of bondage</strong></p>
<p>VIJAY: \"Sir, why are we bound like this? Why don\'t we see God?\"</p>
<p>MASTER : \"Maya is nothing but the egotism of the embodied soul. This
egotism has covered everything like a veil. \'All troubles come to an
end when the ego dies.\' If by the grace of God a man but once realizes
that he is not the doer, then he at once becomes a Jivanmukta. Though
living in the body, he is liberated. He has nothing else to fear.</p>
<p>\"This maya, that is to say, the ego, is like a cloud. The sun cannot be
seen on account of a thin patch of cloud; when that disappears one sees
the sun. If by the grace of the guru one\'s ego vanishes, then one sees
God.</p>
<p>\"Rama, who is God Himself, was only two and a half cubits ahead of
Lakshmana. But Lakshmana couldn\'t see Him because Sita stood between
them. Lakshmana may be compared to the jiva, and Sita to maya. Man
cannot see God on account of the barrier of maya. Just look: I am
creating a barrier in front of my face with this towel. Now you can\'t
see me, even though I am so near. Likewise, God is the nearest of all,
but we cannot see Him on account of this covering of maya.</p>
<p><strong>Maya creates upadhis</strong></p>
<p>\"The jiva is nothing but the embodiment of Satchidananda. But since
maya, or ego, has created various</p>
<p>upadhis, he has forgotten his real Self.</p>
<p>\"Each upadhi changes man\'s nature. If he wears a fine black-bordered
cloth, you will at once find him humming Nidhu Babu\'s love-songs. Then
playing-cards and a walking-stick follow. If even a sickly man puts on
high boots, he begins to whistle and climbs the stairs like an
Englishman, jumping from one step to another. If a man but holds a pen
in his hand, he scribbles on any paper he can get hold of-such is the
power of the pen!</p>
<p>\"Money is also a great upadhi. The possession of money makes such a
difference in a man! He is no longer the same person. A brahmin used to
frequent the temple garden. Outwardly he was very modest. One day I went
to Konnagar with Hriday. No sooner did we get off the boat than we
noticed the brahmin seated on the bank of the Ganges. We thought he had
been enjoying the fresh air. Looking at us, he said: \'Hello there,
priest! How do you do?\' I marked his tone and said to Hriday: \'The man
must have got some money. That\'s why he talks that way.\' Hriday
laughed.</p>
<p>\"A frog had a rupee, which he kept in his hole. One day an elephant was
going over the hole, and the frog, coming out in a fit of anger, raised
his foot, as if to kick the elephant, and said, \'How dare you walk over
my head?\' Such is the pride that money begets!</p>
<p>\"One can get rid of the ego after the attainment of Knowledge. On
attaining Knowledge one goes into samādhi, and the ego disappears. But
it is very difficult to obtain such Knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>Seven planes of the mind</strong></p>
<p>\"It is said in the Vedas that a man experiences samādhi when his mind
ascends to the seventh plane. The ego can disappear only when one goes
into samādhi. Where does the mind of a man ordinarily dwell? In the
first three planes. These are at the organs of evacuation and
generation, and at the navel. Then the mind is immersed only in
worldliness, attached to \'woman and gold\'. A man sees the light of God
when his mind dwells in the plane of the heart. He sees the light and
exclaims: \'Ah! What is this? What is this?\' The next plane is at the
throat. When the mind dwells there he likes to hear and talk only of
God. When the mind ascends to the next plane, in the forehead, between
the eyebrows, he sees the form of Satchidānanda and desires to touch and
embrace It. But he is unable to do so. It is like the light in a
lantern, which you can see but cannot touch. You feel as if you were
touching the light, but in reality you are not. When the mind reaches
the seventh plane, then the ego vanishes completely and the man goes
into samādhi.\"</p>
<p><strong>Indescribability of highest plane</strong></p>
<p>VIJAY: \"What does a man see when he attains the Knowledge of Brahman
after reaching the seventh plane?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"What happens when the mind reaches the seventh plane cannot be
described.</p>
<p>\"Once a boat enters the \'black waters\' of the ocean, it does not
return. Nobody knows what happens to the boat after that. Therefore the
boat cannot give us any information about the ocean.</p>
<p>\"Once a salt doll went to measure the depth of the ocean. No sooner did
it enter the water than it melted. Now who could tell how deep the ocean
was? That which could have told about its depth had melted. Reaching the
seventh plane, the mind is annihilated; man goes into samādhi. What he
feels then cannot be described in words.</p>
<p><strong>The \"wicked I\"</strong></p>
<p>\"The \'I\' that makes one a worldly person and attaches one to \'woman
and gold\' is the \'wicked I\'. The intervention of this ego creates the
difference between jiva and Ātman. Water appears to be divided into two
parts if one puts a stick across it. But in reality there is only one
water. It appears as two on account of the stick. This \'I\' is the
stick. Remove the stick and there remains only one water as before.</p>
<p>\"Now, what is this \'wicked I\'? It is the ego that says: \'What?
Don\'t they know me? I have so much money!</p>
<p>Who is wealthier than I?\' If a thief robs such a man of only ten
rupees, first of all he wrings the money out of the thief, then he gives
him a good beating. But the matter doesn\'t end there: the thief is
handed over to the police and is eventually sent to jail. The \'wicked
I\' says: \'What? Doesn\'t the rogue know whom he has robbed? To steal
my ten rupees! How dare he?\' \"</p>
<p>VIJAY: \"If without destroying the \'I\' a man cannot get rid of
attachment to the world and consequently cannot experience samādhi, then
it would be wise for him to follow the path of Brahmajnāna to attain
samādhi. If the \'I\' persists in the path of devotion, then one should
rather choose the path of knowledge.\"</p>
<p><strong>The \"servant I\"</strong></p>
<p>MASTER: \"It is true that one or two can get rid of the \'I\' through
samādhi; but these cases are very rare. You may indulge in thousands of
reasonings, but still the \'I\' comes back. You may cut the peepal-tree
to the very root today, but you will notice a sprout springing up
tomorrow. Therefore if the \'I\' must remain, let the rascal remain as
the \'servant I\'. As long as you live, you should say, \'O God, Thou
art the Master and I am Thy servant.\' The \'I\' that feels, \'I am the
servant of God, I am His devotee\' does not injure one. Sweet things
cause acidity of the stomach, no doubt, but sugar candy is an exception.</p>
<p>\"The path of knowledge is very difficult. One cannot obtain Knowledge
unless one gets rid of the feeling that one is the body. In the Kaliyuga
the life of man is centred on food. He cannot get rid of the feeling
that he is the body and the ego. Therefore the path of devotion is
prescribed for this cycle.</p>
<p>This is an easy path. You will attain God if you sing His name and
glories and pray to Him with a longing heart. There is not the least
doubt about it.</p>
<p>\"Suppose you draw a line on the surface of water with a bamboo stick.
The water appears to be divided into two parts; but the line doesn\'t
remain for any length of time. The \'servant I\'or the \'devotee I\' or
the \'child I\' is only a line drawn with the ego and is not real\".</p>
<p><strong>The \"ego of a devotee\"</strong></p>
<p>VIJAY (to the Master): \"Sir, you ask us to renounce the \'wicked I\'.
Is there any harm in the \'servant I\'?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"The \'servant I\'-that is, the feeling, \'I am the servant of
God, I am the devotee of God\'-does not injure one. On the contrary, it
helps one to realize God.\"</p>
<p>VIJAY: \"Well, sir, what becomes of the lust, anger, and other passions
of one who keeps the \'servant I\'?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"If a man truly feels like that, then he has only the semblance
of lust, anger, and the like. If, after attaining God, he looks on
himself as the servant or the devotee of God, then he cannot injure
anyone. By touching the philosopher\'s stone a sword is turned into
gold. It keeps the appearance of a sword but cannot injure.</p>
<p>\"When the dry branch of a coconut palm drops to the ground, it leaves
only a mark on the trunk indicating that once there was a branch at that
place. In like manner, he who has attained God keeps only an appearance
of ego; there remains in him only a semblance of anger and lust. He
becomes like a child. A child has no attachment to the three
gunas-sattva, rajas, and tamas. He becomes as quickly detached from a
thing as he becomes attached to it. You can cajole him out of a cloth
worth five rupees with a doll worth an <em>ānnā</em>, though at first he may
say with great determination: \'No, I won\'t give it to you. My daddy
bought it for me.\' Again, all persons are the same to a child. He has
no feeling of high and low in regard to persons. So he doesn\'t
discriminate about caste. If his mother tells him that a particular man
should be regarded as an elder brother, the child will eat from the same
plate with him, though the man may belong to the low caste of a
blacksmith. The child doesn\'t know hate, or what is holy or unholy.</p>
<p>\"Even after attaining samādhi, some retain the \'servant ego\' or the
\'devotee ego\'. The bhakta keeps this \'I-consciousness\'. He says, \'O
God, Thou art the Master and I am Thy servant; Thou art the Lord and I
am Thy devotee.\' He feels that way even after the realization of God.
His \'I\' is not completely effaced. Again, by</p>
<p>constantly practising this kind of \'I-consciousness\', one ultimately
attains God. This is called bhaktiyoga.</p>
<p>\"One can attain the Knowledge of Brahman, too, by following the path of
bhakti. God is all-powerful. He may give His devotee Brahmajnāna also,
if He so wills. But the devotee generally doesn\'t seek the Knowledge of
the Absolute. He would rather have the consciousness that God is the
Master and he the servant, or that God is the Divine Mother and he the
child.\"</p>
<p>VIJAY: \"But those who discriminate according to the Vedanta philosophy
also realize Him in the end, don\'t they?\"</p>
<p><strong>Path of bhakti is easy</strong></p>
<p>MASTER: \"Yes, one may reach Him by following the path of discrimination
too: that is called Jnanayoga. But it is an extremely difficult path. I
have told you already of the seven planes of consciousness. On reaching
the seventh plane the mind goes into samādhi. If a man acquires the firm
knowledge that Brahman alone is real and the world illusory, then his
mind merges in samādhi. But in the Kaliyuga the life of a man depends
entirely on food. How can he have the consciousness that Brahman alone
is real and the world illusory? In the Kaliyuga it is difficult to have
the feeling, \'I am not the body, I am not the mind, I am not the
twenty-four cosmic principles; I am beyond pleasure and pain, I am above
disease and grief, old age and death.\' However you may reason and
argue, the feeling that the body is identical with the soul will somehow
crop up from an unexpected quarter. You may cut a peepal-tree to the
ground and think it is dead to its very root, but the next morning you
will find a new sprout shooting up from the dead stump. One cannot get
rid of this identification with the body; therefore the path of bhakti
is best for the people of the Kaliyuga. It is an easy path.</p>
<p>\"And, \'I don\'t want to become sugar; I want to eat it.\' I never feel
like saying, \'I am Brahman.\' I say, \'Thou art my Lord and I am Thy
servant.\' It is better to make the mind go up and down between the
fifth and sixth planes, like a boat racing between two points. I don\'t
want to go beyond the sixth plane and keep my mind a long time in the
seventh. My desire is to sing the name and glories of God. It is very
good to look on God as the Master and oneself as His servant. Further,
you see, people speak of the waves as belonging to the Ganges; but no
one says that the Ganges belongs to the waves. The feeling, \'I am He\',
is not wholesome. A man who entertains such an idea, while looking on
his body as the Self, causes himself great harm. He cannot go forward in
spiritual life; he drags himself down. He deceives himself as well as
others. He cannot understand his own state of mind.</p>
<p><strong>Prema-bhakti</strong></p>
<p>\"But it isn\'t any and every kind of bhakti that enables one to realize
God. One cannot realize God without prema-bhakti. Another name for
prema-bhakti is raga-bhakti. God cannot be realized without love and
longing. Unless one has learnt to love God, one cannot realize Him.</p>
<p>\"There is another kind of bhakti, known as vaidhi-bhakti, according to
which one must repeat the name of God a fixed number of times, fast,
make pilgrimages, worship God with prescribed offerings, make so many
sacrifices, and so forth and so on. By continuing such practices a long
time one gradually acquires raga-bhakti. God cannot be realized until
one has raga-bhakti. One must love God. In order to realize God one must
be completely free from worldliness and direct all of one\'s mind to
Him.</p>
<p>\"But some acquire raga-bhakti directly. It is innate in them. They have
it from their very childhood. Even at an early age they weep for God. An
instance of such bhakti is to be found in Prahlada. Vaidhi-bhakti is
like moving a fan to make a breeze. One needs the fan to make the
breeze. Similarly, one practises japa, austerity, and fasting, in order
to acquire love of God. But the fan is set aside when the southern
breeze blows of itself.</p>
<p>Such actions as japa and austerity drop away when one spontaneously
feels love and attachment for God. Who, indeed, will perform the
ceremonies enjoined in the scriptures, when mad with love of God?</p>
<p>\"Devotion to God may be said to be \'green\' so long as it doesn\'t
grow into love of God; but it becomes \'ripe\' when it has grown into
such love.</p>
<p>\"A man with \'green\' bhakti cannot assimilate spiritual talk and
instruction; but one with \'ripe\' bhakti can. The image that falls on a
photographic plate covered with black film5 is retained. On the other
hand, thousands of images may be reflected on a bare piece of glass, but
not one of them is retained. As the object moves away, the glass becomes
the same as it was before. One cannot assimilate spiritual instruction
unless one has already developed love of God.\"</p>
<p>VIJAY: \"Is bhakti alone sufficient for the attainment of God, for His
vision?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Yes, one can see God through bhakti alone. But it must be
\'ripe\' bhakti, prema-bhakti and raga-bhakti. When one has that bhakti,
one loves God even as the mother loves the child, the child the mother,
or the wife the husband.</p>
<p>\"When one has such love and attachment for God, one doesn\'t feel the
attraction of maya to wife, children, relatives, and friends. One
retains only compassion for them. To such a man the world appears a
strange land, a place where he has merely to perform his duties. It is
like a man\'s having his real home in the country, but coming to
Calcutta for work; he has to rent a house in Calcutta for the sake of
his duties. When one develops love of God, one completely gets rid of
one\'s attachment to the world and worldly wisdom.</p>
<p>\"One cannot see God if one has even the slightest trace of worldliness.
Match-sticks, if damp, won\'t strike fire though you rub a thousand of
them against the match-box. You only waste a heap of sticks. The mind
soaked in worldliness is such a damp match-stick. Once Sri Radha said to
her friends that she saw Krishna everywhere-both within and without. The
friends answered: \'Why, we don\'t see Him at all. Are you delirious?\'
Radha said, \'Friends, paint your eyes with the collyrium of divine
love, and then you will see Him.\'</p>
<p>(To Vijay) \"It is said in a song of your Brahmo Samaj:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>O Lord, is it ever possible to know Thee without love,</em></p>
<p><em>However much one may perform worship and sacrifice?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>\"If the devotee but once feels this attachment and ecstatic love for
God, this mature devotion and longing, then he sees God in both His
aspects, with form and without form.\"</p>
<p><strong>Purity of heart</strong></p>
<p>VIJAY: \"How can one see God?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"One cannot see God without purity of heart. Through attachment
to \'woman and gold\' the mind has become stained-covered with dirt, as
it were. A magnet cannot attract a needle if the needle is covered with
mud. Wash away the mud and the magnet will draw it. Likewise, the dirt
of the mind can be washed away with the tears of our eyes. This stain is
removed if one sheds tears of repentance and says, \'O God, I shall
never again do such a thing.\' Thereupon God, who is like the magnet,
draws to Himself the mind, which is like the needle. Then the devotee
goes into samādhi and obtains the vision of God.</p>
<p><strong>God\'s grace is the ultimate help</strong></p>
<p>\"You may try thousands of times, but nothing can be achieved without
God\'s grace. One cannot see God without His grace. Is it an easy thing
to receive the grace of God? One must altogether renounce egotism; one
cannot see God as long as one feels, \'I am the doer.\' Suppose, in a
family, a man has taken charge of the store-room; then if someone asks
the master, \'Sir, will you yourself kindly give me something from the
store-room?\', the master says to him: \'There is already someone in the
store-room. What can I do there?\'</p>
<p>\"God doesn\'t easily appear in the heart of a man who feels himself to
be his own master. But God can be seen the moment His grace descends. He
is the Sun of Knowledge. One single ray of His has illumined the world
with the light of knowledge. That is how we are able to see one another
and acquire varied knowledge.</p>
<p>One can see God only if He turns His light toward His own face.</p>
<p>\"The police sergeant goes his rounds in the dark of night with a
lantern6 in his hand. No one sees his face; but with the help of that
light the sergeant sees everybody\'s face, and others, too, can see one
another. If you want to see the sergeant, however, you must pray to him:
\'Sir, please turn the light on your own face. Let me see you.\' In the
same way one must pray to God: \'O Lord, be gracious and turn the light
of knowledge on Thyself, that I may see Thy face.\'</p>
<p>\"A house without light indicates poverty. So one must light the lamp of
Knowledge in one\'s heart. As it is said in a song:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Lighting the lamp of Knowledge in the chamber of your heart, Behold
the face of the Mother, Brahman\'s Embodiment.\"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As Vijay had brought medicine with him, the Master asked a devotee to
give him some water. He was indeed a fountain of infinite compassion. He
had arranged for Vijay\'s boat fare, since the latter was too poor to
pay it. Vijay, Balaram, M., and the other devotees left for Calcutta in
a country boat.</p>
<p><strong>Monday, January 1, 1883</strong></p>
<p>At eight o\'clock in the morning Sri Ramakrishna was seated on a mat
spread on the floor of his room at Dakshineswar. Since it was a cold
day, he had wrapped his body in his moleskin shawl. Prankrishna and M.
were seated in front of him. Rakhal, too, was in the room. Prankrishna
was a high government official and lived in Calcutta. Since he had had
no offspring by his first wife, with her permission he had married a
second time. By the second wife he had a son. Because he was rather
stout, the Master addressed him now and then as \"the fat brahmin\". He
had great respect for Sri Ramakrishna. Though a householder, Prankrishna
studied the Vedanta and had been heard to say: \"Brahman alone is real
and the world illusory. I am He.\" The Master used to say to him: \"In
the Kaliyuga the life of a man depends on food. The path of devotion
prescribed by Narada is best for this age.\"</p>
<p>A devotee had brought a basket of jilipi for the Master, which the
latter kept by his side. Eating a bit of the sweets, he said to
Prankrishna with a smile: \"You see, I chant the name of the Divine
Mother; so I get all these good things to eat. (Laughter.) But She
doesn\'t give such fruits as gourd or pumpkin. She bestows the fruit of
Amrita, Immortality-knowledge, love, discrimination, renunciation, and
so forth.\"</p>
<p>A boy six or seven years old entered the room. The Master himself became
like a child. He covered the contents of the basket with the palm or his
hand, as a child does to conceal sweets from another child lest the
latter should snatch them. Then he put the basket aside.</p>
<p>Suddenly the Master went into samādhi and sat thus a long time. His body
was transfixed, his eyes wide open and unwinking, his breathing hardly
perceptible. After a long time he drew a deep breath, indicating his
return to the world of sense.</p>
<p><strong>Vision of Divine Mother</strong></p>
<p>MASTER (to Prankrishna): \"My Divine Mother is not only formless, She
has forms as well. One can see Her forms. One can behold Her
incomparable beauty through feeling and love. The Mother reveals Herself
to Her devotees in different forms.</p>
<p>\"I saw Her yesterday. She was clad in a seamless ochre-coloured
garment, and She talked with me.</p>
<p>\"She came to me another day as a Mussalman girl six or seven years old.
She had a tilak on her forehead and was naked. She walked with me,
joking and frisking like a child.</p>
<p>\"At Hriday\'s house I had a vision of Gauranga. He wore a
black-bordered cloth.</p>
<p>\"Haladhāri used to say that God is beyond both Being and Non-being. I
told the Mother about it and asked</p>
<p>Her, \'Then is the divine form an illusion?\' The Divine Mother appeared
to me in the form of Rati\'s mother and said, \'Do thou remain in
<strong><em>Bhāva</em>\'</strong> I repeated this to Haladhāri. Now and then I forget Her
command and suffer. Once I broke my teeth because I didn\'t remain in
bhava. So I shall remain in bhava unless I receive a revelation from
heaven or have a direct experience to the contrary. I shall follow the
path of love. What do you say?\"</p>
<p>PRANKRISHNA: \"Yes, sir.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"But why should I ask you about it? There is Someone within me
who does all these things through me. At times I used to remain in a
mood of Godhood and would enjoy no peace of mind unless I were being
worshipped.</p>
<p>\"I am the machine and God is the Operator. I act as He makes me act. I
speak as He makes me speak. Keep your raft, says Ramprasad, afloat on
the sea of life, Drifting up with the flood-tide, drifting down with the
ebb.</p>
<p>\"It is like the cast-off leaf before a gale; sometimes it is blown to a
good place and sometimes into the gutter, according to the direction of
the wind.</p>
<p>\"As the weaver said in the story: \'The robbery was committed by the
will of Rama, I was arrested by the police by the will of Rama, and
again, by the will of Rama, I was set free.\'</p>
<p>\"Hanuman once said to Rama: \'O Rama, I have taken refuge in Thee.
Bless me that I may have pure devotion to Thy Lotus Feet and that I may
not be caught in the spell of Thy world-bewitching maya.\'</p>
<p>\"Once a dying bullfrog said to Rama: \'O Rama, when caught by a snake I
cry for Your protection. But now I am about to die, struck by Your
arrow. Hence I am silent.\'</p>
<p><strong>God\'s nature like that of a child</strong></p>
<p>\"I used to see God directly with these very eyes, just as I see you.
Now I see divine visions in trance.</p>
<p>\"After realizing God a man becomes like a child. One acquires the
nature of the object one meditates upon. The nature of God is like that
of a child. As a child builds up his toy house and then breaks it down,
so God acts while creating, preserving, and destroying the universe.
Further, as the child is not under the control of any guna, so God is
beyond the three gunas-sattva, rajas, and tamas. That is why
paramahamsas keep five or ten children with them, that they may assume
their nature.\"</p>
<p>Sitting on the floor in the room was a young man from Agarpara about
twenty-two years old. Whenever he came to the temple garden, he would
take the Master aside, by a sign, and whisper his thoughts to him. He
was a new-comer. That day he was sitting on the floor near the Master.</p>
<p>MASTER (to the young man): \"A man can change his nature by imitating
another\'s character. He can get rid of a passion like lust by assuming
the feminine mood. He gradually comes to act exactly like a woman. I
have noticed that men who take female parts in the theatre speak like
women or brush their teeth like women while bathing. Come again on a
Tuesday or Saturday.</p>
<p>(To Prankrishna) \"Brahman and Śakti are inseparable. Unless you accept
Śakti, you will find the whole universe unreal-\'I\', \'you\', house,
buildings, and family. The world stands solid because the Primordial
Energy stands behind it. If there is no supporting pole, no framework
can be made, and without the framework there can be no beautiful image
of Durga.</p>
<p>\"Without giving up worldliness a man cannot awaken his spiritual
consciousness, nor can he realize God. He cannot but be a hypocrite as
long as he has even a trace of worldly desire. God cannot be realized
without guilelessness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Cherish love within your heart; abandon cunning and deceit:</em></p>
<p><em>Through service, worship, selflessness, does Rama\'s blessed vision
come.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even those engaged in worldly activities, such as office work or
business, should hold to the truth. Truthfulness alone is the spiritual
discipline in the Kaliyuga.\"</p>
<p>PRANKRISHNA: \"Yes, sir. It is said in the Mahanirvana Tantra: \'O
Goddess, this religion enjoins it upon one to be truthful,
self-controlled, devoted to the welfare of others, unagitated, and
compassionate.\'\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Yes. But these ideas must be assimilated.\"</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna was sitting on the small couch. He was in an ecstatic
mood and looked at Rakhal. Suddenly he was filled with the tender
feeling of parental love toward his young disciple and spiritual child.
Presently he went into samādhi. The devotees sat speechless, looking at
the Master with wondering eyes.</p>
<p>Regaining partial consciousness, the Master said: \"Why is my spiritual
feeling kindled at the sight of Rakhal? The more you advance toward God,
the less you will see of His glories and grandeur. The aspirant at first
has a vision of the Goddess with ten arms;8 there is a great display of
power in that image. The next vision is that of the Deity with two arms;
there are no longer ten arms holding various weapons and missiles. Then
the aspirant has a vision of Gopala, in which there is no trace of
power. It is the form of a tender child. Beyond that there are other
visions also. The aspirant then sees only Light.</p>
<p>\"Reasoning and discrimination vanish after the attainment of God and
communion with Him in samādhi. How long does a man reason and
discriminate? As long as he is conscious of the manifold, as long as he
is aware of the universe, of embodied beings, of \'I\' and \'you\'. He
becomes silent when he is truly aware of Unity. This was the case with
Trailanga Swami.</p>
<p>\"Have you watched a feast given to the brahmins? At first there is a
great uproar. But the noise lessens as their stomachs become more and
more filled with food. When the last course of curd and sweets is
served, one hears only the sound \'soop, soop\' as they scoop up the
curd in their hands. There is no other sound. Next is the stage of
sleep-samādhi. There is no more uproar.</p>
<p>(To M. and Prankrishna) \"Many people talk of Brahmajnāna, but their
minds are always preoccupied with lower things: house, buildings, money,
name, and sense pleasures. As long as you stand at the foot of the
Monument,10 so long do you see horses, carriages, Englishmen, and
Englishwomen. But when you climb to its top, you behold the sky and the
ocean stretching to infinity. Then you do not enjoy buildings,
carriages, horses, or men. They look like ants.</p>
<p>\"All such things as attachment to the world and enthusiasm for \'woman
and gold\' disappear after the attainment of the Knowledge of Brahman.
Then comes the cessation of all passions. When the log burns, it makes a
crackling noise and one sees the flame. But when the burning is over and
only ash remains, then no more noise is heard. Thirst disappears with
the destruction of attachment. Finally comes peace.</p>
<p>\"The nearer you come to God, the more you feel peace. Peace, peace,
peace-supreme peace! The nearer you come to the Ganges, the more you
feel its coolness. You will feel completely soothed when you plunge into
the river.</p>
<p>\"But the universe and its created beings, and the twenty-four cosmic
principles, all exist because God exists. Nothing remains if God is
eliminated. The number increases if you put many zeros after the figure
one; but the zeros don\'t have any value if the one is not there.\"</p>
<p>The Master continued: \"There are some who come down, as it were, after
attaining the Knowledge of Brahman-after samādhi-and retain the \'ego of
Knowledge\' or the \'ego of Devotion\', just as there are people who, of
their own sweet will, stay in the market-place after the market breaks
up. This was the case with sages like Narada. They kept the \'ego of
Devotion\' for the purpose of teaching men. Sankaracharya kept the</p>
<p>\'ego of Knowledge\' for the same purpose.</p>
<p>\"God cannot be realized if there is the slightest attachment to the
things of the world. A thread cannot pass through the eye of a needle if
the tiniest fibre sticks out.</p>
<p>\"The anger and lust of a man who has realized God are only appearances.
They are like a burnt string. It looks like a string, but a mere puff
blows it away.</p>
<p>\"God is realized as soon as the mind becomes free from attachment.
Whatever appears in the Pure Mind is the voice of God. That which is
Pure Mind is also Pure Buddhi; that, again, is Pure Ātman, because there
is nothing pure but God. But in order to realize God one must go beyond
dharma and adharma.\"</p>
<p>The Master sang in his melodious voice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Come, let us go for a walk, O mind, to Kāli, the Wish-fulfilling
Tree, And there beneath It gather the four fruits of life. . . .</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna went out on the southeast verandah of his room and sat
down. Prankrishna and the other devotees accompanied him. Hazra, too,
was sitting there. The Master said to Prankrishna with a smile: \"Hazra
is not a man to be trifled with. If one finds the big dargah here, then
Hazra is the smaller dargah.\" All laughed at the Master\'s words. A
certain gentleman, Navakumar by name, came to the door and stood there.
At sight of the devotees he immediately left. \"Oh! Egotism incarnate!\"
Sri Ramakrishna remarked.</p>
<p>About half past nine in the morning Prankrishna took leave of the
Master. Soon afterwards a minstrel sang some devotional songs to the
accompaniment of a stringed instrument. The Master was listening to the
songs when Kedār Chatterji, a householder devotee, entered the room clad
in his office clothes. He was a man of devotional temperament and
cherished the attitude of the gopis of Vrindāvan. Words about God would
make him weep.</p>
<p>The sight of Kedār awakened in the Master\'s mind the episode of
Vrindāvan in Sri Krishna\'s life. Intoxicated with divine love, the
Master stood up and sang, addressing Kedār:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Tell me, friend, how far is the grove</em></p>
<p><em>Where Krishna, my Beloved, dwells?</em></p>
<p><em>His fragrance reaches me even here;</em></p>
<p><em>But I am tired and can walk no farther. . . .</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna assumed the attitude of Sri Radha to Krishna and went
into deep samādhi while singing the song. He stood there, still as a
picture on canvas, with tears of divine joy running down his cheeks.</p>
<p>Kedār knelt before the Master. Touching his feet, he chanted a hymn:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>We worship the Brahman-Consciousness in the Lotus of the Heart,</em></p>
<p><em>The Undifferentiated, who is adored by Hari, Hara, and Brahma;</em></p>
<p><em>Who is attained by yogis in the depths of their meditation;</em></p>
<p><em>The Scatterer of the fear of birth and death,</em></p>
<p><em>The Essence of Knowledge and Truth, the Primal Seed of the world.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After a time the Master regained consciousness of the relative world.
Soon Kedār took his leave and returned to his office in Calcutta.</p>
<p>At midday Ramlal brought the Master a plate of food that had been
offered in the Kāli temple. Like a child he ate a little of everything.</p>
<p>Later in the afternoon several Marwari devotees entered the Master\'s
room, where Rakhal and M. also were</p>
<p>seated.</p>
<p>A MARWARI DEVOTEE: \"Sir, what is the way?\"</p>
<p><strong>Two ways of God-realization</strong></p>
<p>MASTER: \"There are two ways. One is the path of discrimination, the
other is that of love. Discrimination means to know the distinction
between the Real and the unreal. God alone is the real and permanent
Substance; all else is illusory and impermanent. The magician alone is
real; his magic is illusory. This is discrimination.</p>
<p>\"Discrimination and renunciation. Discrimination means to know the
distinction between the Real and the unreal. Renunciation means to have
dispassion for the things of the world. One cannot acquire them all of a
sudden. They must be practised every day. One should renounce \'woman
and gold\' mentally at first. Then, by the will of God, one can renounce
it both mentally and outwardly. It is impossible to ask the people of
Calcutta to renounce all for the sake of God. One has to tell them to
renounce mentally.</p>
<p><strong>Constant practice urged</strong></p>
<p>\"Through the discipline of constant practice one is able to give up
attachment to \'woman and gold\'. That is what the Gita says. By
practice one acquires uncommon power of mind. Then one doesn\'t find it
difficult to subdue the sense-organs and to bring anger, lust, and the
like under control. Such a man behaves like a tortoise, which, once it
has tucked in its limbs, never puts them out. You cannot make the
tortoise put its limbs out again, though you chop it to pieces with an
axe.\"</p>
<p>MARWARI DEVOTEE: \"Revered sir, you just mentioned two paths. What is
the other path?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"The path of bhakti, or zealous love of God. Weep for God in
solitude, with a restless soul, and ask</p>
<p>Him to reveal Himself to you. Cry to your Mother Syama with a real cry,
O mind! And how can She hold</p>
<p>Herself from you? \"</p>
<p>MARWARI DEVOTEE: \"Sir, what is the meaning of the worship of the
Personal God? And what is the meaning of God without form or
attribute?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"As you recall your father by his photograph, so likewise the
worship of the image reveals in a flash the nature of Reality.</p>
<p>\"Do you know what God with form is like? Like bubbles rising on an
expanse of water, various divine forms are seen to rise out of the Great
Ākāśa of Consciousness. The Incarnation of God is one of these forms.
The Primal Energy sports, as it were, through the activities of a Divine
Incarnation.</p>
<p>\"What is there in mere scholarship? God can be attained by crying to
Him with a longing heart. There is no need to know many things.</p>
<p>\"He who is an Āchārya has to know different things. One needs a sword
and shield to kill others; but to kill oneself, a needle or a nail-knife
suffices.</p>
<p>\"One ultimately discovers God by trying to know who this \'I\' is. Is
this \'I\' the flesh, the bones, the blood, or the marrow? Is it the
mind or the buddhi? Analysing thus, you realize at last that you are
none of these. This is called the process of \'Neti, neti\', \'Not this,
not this\'. One can neither comprehend nor touch the Ātman. It is
without qualities or attributes.</p>
<p>\"But, according to the path of devotion, God has attributes. To a
devotee Krishna is Spirit, His Abode is Spirit, and everything about Him
is Spirit.\"</p>
<p>The Marwari devotees saluted the Master and took their leave.</p>
<p>At the approach of evening Sri Ramakrishna went out to look at the
sacred river. The lamp was lighted in his room. The Master chanted the
hallowed name of the Divine Mother and meditated on Her. Then the
evening worship began in the various temples. The sound of gongs,
floating on the air, mingled with the murmuring voice of the river.
Peace and blessedness reigned everywhere.</p>
