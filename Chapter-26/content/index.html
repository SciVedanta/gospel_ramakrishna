<p>ADVICE TO PUNDIT SHASHADHAR</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Monday, June 30, 1884</p>
</blockquote>
<p>SRI RAMAKRISHNA was in his room, sitting on a mat spread on the floor.
Pundit Shashadhar and a few</p>
<p>devotees were with him on the mat, and the rest sat on the bare floor.
Surendra, Baburam, M., Harish, Lātu,</p>
<p>Hazra, and others were present. It was about four o\'clock in the
afternoon.</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna had met Pundit Shashadhar six days before in Calcutta,
and now the pundit had come to Dakshineswar to visit the Master. Bhudar
Chattopadhyaya and his elder brother, the pundit\'s hosts, were with
him.</p>
<p><strong>Nature of Brahman</strong></p>
<p>The pundit was a follower of the path of jnāna. The Master was
explaining this path to him. He said: \"Nityā and Lila are the two
aspects of one and the same Reality. He who is the Indivisible
Satchidananda has assumed different forms for the sake of His Lila.\" As
he described the nature of the Ultimate Reality the Master every now and
then became unconscious in samādhi. While he talked he was intoxicated
with spiritual fervour. He said to the pundit: \"My dear sir, Brahman is
immutalble and immovable, like Mount Sumeru. But He who is \'immovable\'
can also \'move\'.\"</p>
<p><strong>Glories of Kāli</strong></p>
<p>The Master was in ecstasy. He began to sing in his melodious voice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Who is there that can understand what Mother Kāli is?</em></p>
<p><em>Even the six darsanas are powerless to reveal Her. . . .</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He went on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Is Mother merely a simple woman, born as others are born?</em></p>
<p><em>Only by chanting Her holy name</em></p>
<p><em>Does Śiva survive the deadly poison.</em></p>
<p><em>She it is who creates the worlds, She who preserves and destroys,</em></p>
<p><em>With a mere wink of Her wondrous eyes;</em></p>
<p><em>She holds the universe in Her womb.</em></p>
<p><em>Seeking a shelter at Her feet, the gods themselves feel safe; And
Mahadeva, God of Gods, Lies prostrate underneath Her feet.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again he sang:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Is Mother only Śiva\'s wife? To Her must needs bow down</em></p>
<p><em>The all-destroying King of Death!</em></p>
<p><em>Naked She roams about the world, slaying Her demon foes,</em></p>
<p><em>Or stands erect on Śiva\'s breast.</em></p>
<p><em>Her feet upon Her Husband\'s form! What a strange wife She makes!</em></p>
<p><em>My Mother\'s play, declares Prasad, shatters all rules and laws:</em></p>
<p><em>Strive hard for purity, O mind,</em></p>
<p><em>And understand my Mother\'s ways.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I drink no ordinary wine, but Wine of Everlasting Bliss,</em></p>
<p><em>As I repeat my Mother Kāli\'s name;</em></p>
<p><em>It so intoxicates my mind that people take me to be drunk! . . .</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Can everyone have the vision of Syama? Is Kāli\'s treasure for
everyone?</em></p>
<p><em>Oh, what a pity my foolish mind will not see what is true!</em></p>
<p><em>Even with all His penances, rarely does Śiva Himself behold</em></p>
<p><em>The mind-bewitching sight of Mother Syama\'s crimson feet.</em></p>
<p><em>To him who meditates on Her the riches of heaven are poor indeed;</em></p>
<p><em>If Syama casts Her glance on him, he swims in Eternal Bliss.</em></p>
<p><em>The prince of yogis, the king of the gods, meditate on Her feet in
vain</em></p>
<p><em>Yet worthless kamalakanta yearns for the Mother\'s blessed feet!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Master\'s ecstatic mood gradually relaxed. He stopped singing and
sat in silence. After a while he got up and sat on the small couch.</p>
<p>Pundit Shashadhar was charmed with his singing. Very humbly he said to
Sri Ramakrishna, \"Are you going to sing anymore?\"</p>
<p>A little later the Master sang again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>High in the heaven of the Mother\'s feet, my mind was soaring like a
kite,</em></p>
<p><em>When came a blast of sin\'s rough wind that drove it swiftly toward
the earth. . . .</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then he sang:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Once for all, this time, I have thoroughly understood;</em></p>
<p><em>From One who knows it well, I have learnt the secret of bhava.</em></p>
<p><em>A man has come to me from a country where there is no night,</em></p>
<p><em>And now I cannot distinguish day from night any longer;</em></p>
<p><em>Rituals and devotions have all grown profitless for me.</em></p>
<p><em>My sleep is broken; how can I slumber any more?</em></p>
<p><em>For now I am wide awake in the sleeplessness of yoga.</em></p>
<p><em>O Divine Mother, made one with Thee in yoga-sleep at last, My slumber
I have lulled asleep for evermore.</em></p>
<p><em>I bow my head, says Prasad, before desire and liberation; Knowing the
secret that Kāli is one with the highest Brahman, I have discarded,
once for all, both righteousness and sin.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna continued:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I have surrendered my soul at the fearless feet of the Mother;</em></p>
<p><em>Am I afraid of Death any more?</em></p>
<p><em>Unto the tuft of hair on my head.</em></p>
<p><em>Is tied the almighty mantra, Mother Kāli\'s name.</em></p>
<p><em>My body I have sold in the market-place of the world</em></p>
<p><em>And with it have bought Sri Durga\'s name.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As Sri Ramakrishna sang the line, \"And with it have bought Sri Durga\'s
name\", the tears flowed from Pundit Shashadhar\'s eyes. The Master went
on with the song:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Deep within my heart I have planted the name of Kāli,</em></p>
<p><em>The Wish-fulfilling Tree of heaven;</em></p>
<p><em>When Yama, King of Death, appears,</em></p>
<p><em>To him I shall open my heart and show it growing there.</em></p>
<p><em>I have cast out from me my six unflagging foes;4</em></p>
<p><em>Ready am I to sail life\'s sea,</em></p>
<p><em>Crying, \"To Durga, victory!\"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again he sang:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Dwell, O mind, within yourself;</em></p>
<p><em>Enter no other\'s home.</em></p>
<p><em>If you but seek there, you will find</em></p>
<p><em>All you are searching for. . . .</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Though I am never loath to grant salvation,</em></p>
<p><em>I hesitate indeed to grant pure love.</em></p>
<p><em>Whoever wins pure love surpasses all;</em></p>
<p><em>He is adored by men;</em></p>
<p><em>He triumphs over the three worlds. . . .</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Mere study of scriptures is futile</strong></p>
<p>The pundit had studied the Vedas and the other scriptures. He loved to
discuss philosophy. The Master, seated on the couch, cast his benign
look on the pundit and gave him counsel through parables.</p>
<p>MASTER (to the pundit): \"There are many scriptures like the Vedas. But
one cannot realize God without austerity and spiritual discipline. \'God
cannot be found in the six systems, the Vedas, or the Tantra.\'</p>
<p>\"But one should learn the contents of the scriptures and then act
according to their injunctions. A man lost a letter. He couldn\'t
remember where he had left it. He began to search for it with a lamp.
After two or three people had searched, the letter was at last found.
The message in the letter was: \'Please send us five seers of sandesh
and a piece of wearing-cloth.\' The man read it and then threw the
letter away. There was no further need of it; now all he had to do was
to buy the five seers of sandesh and the piece of cloth.</p>
<p><strong>Reading, hearing, and seeing</strong></p>
<p>\"Better than reading is hearing, and better than hearing is seeing. One
understands the scriptures better by hearing them from the lips of the
guru or of a holy man. Then one doesn\'t have to think about their
non-essential part.</p>
<p>Hanuman said: \'Brother, I don\'t know much about the phase of the moon
or the position of the stars. I just contemplate Rāma.\'</p>
<p>\"But seeing is far better than hearing. Then all doubts disappear. It
is true that many things are recorded in the scriptures; but all these
are useless without the direct realization of God, without devotion to
His Lotus Feet, without purity of heart. The almanac forecasts the
rainfall of the year. But not a drop of water will you get by squeezing
the almanac. No, not even one drop.</p>
<p>\"How long should one reason about the texts of the scriptures? So long
as one does not have direct realization of God. How long does the bee
buzz about? As long as it is not sitting on a flower. No sooner does it
light on a flower and begin to sip honey than it keeps quiet.</p>
<p>\"But you must remember another thing. One may talk even after the
realization of God. But then one talks only of God and of Divine Bliss.
It is like a drunkard\'s crying, \'Victory to the Divine Mother!\' He
can hardly say anything else on account of his drunkenness. You can
notice, too, that a bee makes an indistinct humming sound after having
sipped the honey from a flower.</p>
<p><strong>The nature of jnanis and vijnanis</strong></p>
<p>\"The Jnāni reasons about the world through the process of \'Neti,
neti\', \'Not this, not this\'. Reasoning in this way, he at last comes
to a state of Bliss, and that is Brahman. What is the nature of a Jnāni?
He behaves according to scriptural injunctions.</p>
<p>\"Once I was taken to Chanak and saw some sādhus there. Several of them
were sewing. (All laugh.) At the sight of us they threw aside their
sewing. They sat straight, crossing their legs, and conversed with us.
(All laugh.)</p>
<p>\"But jnanis will not talk about spiritual things without being asked.
They will inquire, at first, about such things as your health and your
family.</p>
<p>\"But the nature of the vijnāni is different. He is unconcerned about
anything. Perhaps he carries his wearing-cloth loose under his arm, like
a child; or perhaps the cloth has dropped from his body altogether.</p>
<p>\"The man who knows that God exists is called a Jnāni. A Jnāni is like
one who knows beyond a doubt that a log of wood contains fire. But a
vijnāni is he who lights the log, cooks over the fire, and is nourished
by the food. The eight fetters have fallen from the vijnāni. He may keep
merely the appearance of lust, anger, and the rest.\"</p>
<p>PUNDIT: \"The knots of his heart are cut asunder; all his doubts are
destroyed.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Yes. Once a ship sailed into the ocean. Suddenly its iron
joints, nails, and screws fell out. The ship was passing a magnetic
hill, and so all its iron was loosened.</p>
<p>\"I used to go to Krishnakishore\'s house. Once, when I was there, he
said to me, \'Why do you chew betel-leaf?\'</p>
<ol>
<li>said: \'It is my sweet pleasure. I shall chew betel-leaf, look at my
    face in the mirror, and dance naked among a thousand girls.\'6
    Krishnakishore\'s wife scolded him and said: \'What have you said to
    Ramakrishna? You don\'t know how to talk to people.\'</li>
</ol>
<p>\"In this state, passions like lust and anger are burnt up, though
nothing happens to the physical body. It looks just like any other body;
but the inside is all hollow and pure.\"</p>
<p>A DEVOTEE: \"Does the body remain even after the realization of God?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"The body survives with some so that they may work out their
prarabdha karma or work for the welfare of others. By bathing in the
Ganges a man gets rid of his sin and attains liberation. But if he
happens to be blind, he doesn\'t get rid of his blindness. Of course, he
escapes future births, which would otherwise be necessary for reaping
the results of his past sinful karma. His present body remains alive as
long as its momentum7 is not exhausted; but future births are no longer
possible. The wheel moves as long as the impulse that has set it in
motion lasts. Then it comes to a stop. In the case of such a person,
passions like lust and anger are burnt up. Only the body remains alive
to perform a few actions.\"</p>
<p>PUNDIT: \"That is called samskara.\"</p>
<p><strong>The nature of jnanis and vijnanis</strong></p>
<p>MASTER: \"The vijnāni always sees God. That is why he is so indifferent
about the world. He sees God even with his eyes open. Sometimes he comes
down to the Lila from the Nitya, and sometimes he goes up to the Nitya
from the Lila.\"</p>
<p>PUNDIT: \"I don\'t understand that.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"The Jnāni reasons about the world through the process of
\'Neti, neti\', and at last reaches the Eternal and Indivisible
Satchidananda. He reasons in this manner: \'Brahman is not the living
beings; It is neither the universe nor the twenty-four cosmic
principles.\' As a result of such reasoning he attains the Absolute.
Then he realizes that it is the Absolute that has become all this-the
universe, its living beings, and the twenty-four cosmic principles.</p>
<p>\"Milk sets into curd, and the curd is churned into butter. After
extracting the butter one realizes that butter is not essentially
different from buttermilk and buttermilk not essentially different from
butter. The bark of a tree goes with the pith and the pith goes with the
bark.\"</p>
<p>PUNDIT (smiling, to Bhudar): \"Did you understand that? It is very
difficult.\"</p>
<p><strong>All-embracing realization of the vijnāni</strong></p>
<p>MASTER: \"If there is butter, there must be buttermilk also. If you
think of butter, you must also think of buttermilk along with it; for
there cannot be any butter without buttermilk. Just so, if you accept
the Nitya, you must also accept the Lila. It is the process of negation
and affirmation. You realize the Nitya by negating the Lila. Then you
affirm the Lila, seeing in it the manifestation of the Nitya. One
attains this state after realizing Reality in both aspects: Personal and
Impersonal. The Personal is the embodiment of Chit, Consciousness; and
the Impersonal is the Indivisible Satchidananda.</p>
<p>\"Brahman alone has become everything. Therefore to be vijnāni this
world is a \'mansion of myrth\'. But to the Jnāni it is a \'framework of
illusion\'. Ramprasad described the world as a \'framework of
illusion\'. Another man said to him by way of retort:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>This very world is a mansion of myrth;</em></p>
<p><em>Here I can eat, here drink and make merry.</em></p>
<p><em>O physician, you are a fool!</em></p>
<p><em>You see only the surface of things.</em></p>
<p><em>Janaka\'s might was unsurpassed;</em></p>
<p><em>What did he lack of the world or the Spirit?</em></p>
<p><em>Holding to one as well as the other,</em></p>
<p><em>He drank his milk from a brimming cup!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>\"The vijnāni enjoys the bliss of God in a richer way. Some have heard
of milk, some have seen it, and some have drunk it. The vijnāni has
drunk milk, enjoyed it, and been nourished by it.\"</p>
<p>The Master remained silent a few moments and then asked Pundit
Shashadhar to have a smoke. The Pundit went to the south east verandah
to smoke. Soon he came back to the room and sat on the floor with the
devotees. Seated on the small couch, the Master continued the
conversation.</p>
<p>MASTER (to the Pundit): \"Let me tell you something. There are three
kinds of Ānanda, joy: the joy of worldly enjoyment, the joy of worship,
and the Joy of Brahman. The joy of worldly enjoyment is the joy of
\'woman and gold\', which people always enjoy. The joy of worship one
enjoys while chanting the name and glories of God. And the Joy of
Brahman is the joy of God-vision. After experiencing the joy of
God-vision the rishis of olden times went beyond all rules and
conventions.</p>
<p><strong>Three states of God-Consciousness</strong></p>
<p>\"Chaitanyadeva used to experience three spiritual states: the inmost,
the semi-conscious, and the conscious. In the inmost state he would see
God and go into samādhi. He would be in the state of jada samādhi. In
the semi-conscious state he would be partially conscious of the outer
world. In the conscious state he could sing the name and glories of
God.\"</p>
<p>HAZRA (to the Pundit): \"So your doubts are now solved.\"</p>
<p><strong>Samādhi described</strong></p>
<p>MASTER (to the Pundit): \"What is samādhi? It is the complete merging of
the mind in God-Consciousness. The Jnāni experiences jada samādhi, in
which no trace of \'I\' is left. The samādhi attained through the path
of bhakti is called \'chetana samādhi\'. In this samādhi there remains
the conciousness of \'I\' ― the \'I\' of the servant-and-Master
relationship, of the lover-and-Beloved relationship, of the
enjoyer-and-Food relationship. God is the Master; the devotee is the
servant. God is the beloved; the devotee is the lover. God is the Food,
and the devotee is the enjoyer. \'I don\'t want to be sugar. I want to
eat it.\' \"</p>
<p>PUNDIT : \"What will happen if God dissolves all of the \'I\', if He
changes the enjoyer himself into sugar?\"</p>
<p>MASTER (smiling): \"Come, come! Tell me what is in your mind. But don\'t
the scriptures mention Nārada,</p>
<p>Sanaka, Sanatana, Sananda, and Sanatkumara?\"</p>
<p>PUNDIT: \"Yes, sir. They do.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Though they were jnanis, yet they kept the \'I\' of the
bhakta. Haven\'t you read the Bhagavata?\"</p>
<p>PUNDIT: \"I have read only part of it, not the whole.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Pray to God. He is full of compassion. Will He not listen to
the words of His devotee? He is the Kalpataru. You will get whatever you
desire from Him.\"</p>
<p>PUNDIT: \"I haven\'t thought deeply about these things before. But now I
understand.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"God keeps a little of \'I\' in His devotee even after giving
him the Knowledge of Brahman. That \'I\' is the \'I of the devotee\',
the \'I of the Jnāni\'. Through that \'I\' the devotee enjoys the
infinite play of God.</p>
<p>\"The pestle was almost worn out with rubbing. Only a little was left.
That fell into the underbrush and brought about the destruction of the
lunar race, the race of the Yadus. The vijnāni retains the \'I of the
devotee\', the \'I of the Jnāni\', in order to taste the Bliss of God
and teach people.</p>
<p>\"The rishis of old had timid natures. They were easily frightened. Do
you know their attitude? It was this: \'Let me somehow get my own
salvation; who cares for others?\' A hollow piece of drift-wood somehow
manages to float; but it sinks if even a bird sits on it. But Nārada and
sages of his kind are like a huge log that not only can float across to
the other shore but can carry many animals and other creatures as well.
A steamship itself crosses the ocean and also carries people across.</p>
<p><strong>The vijnāni is fearless and joyous</strong></p>
<p>\"Teachers like Nārada belong to the class of the vijnāni. They were
much more courageous than the other rishis. They are like an expert
satrancha-player. You must have noticed how he shouts, as he throws the
dice: \'What do I want? Six? No, five! Here is five!\' And every time he
throws the dice he gets the number he wants. He is such a clever player!
And while playing he even twirls his moustaches.</p>
<p>\"A mere Jnāni trembles with fear. He is like an amateur
satrancha-player. He is anxious to move his pieces somehow to the safety
zone, where they won\'t be overtaken by his opponent. But a vijnāni
isn\'t afraid of anything. He has realized both aspects of God: Personal
and Impersonal. He has talked with God. He has enjoyed the Bliss of God.</p>
<p>\"It is a joy to merge the mind in the Indivisible Brahman through
contemplation. And it is also a joy to keep the mind on the Lila, the
Relative, without dissolving it in the Absolute.</p>
<p>\"A mere Jnāni is a monotonous person. He always analyses, saying: \'It
is not this, not this. The world is like a dream.\' But I have \'raised
both my hands\'. Therefore I accept everything.</p>
<p><strong>Parable of the weaver woman</strong></p>
<p>\"Listen to a story. Once a woman went to see her weaver friend. The
weaver, who had been spinning different kinds of silk thread, was very
happy to see her friend and said to her: \'Friend, I can\'t tell you how
happy I am to see you. Let me get you some refreshments.\' She left the
room. The woman looked at the threads of different colours and was
tempted. She hid a bundle of thread under one arm. The weaver returned
presently with the refreshments and began to feed her guest with great
enthusiasm. But, looking at the thread, she realized that her friend had
taken a bundle. Hitting upon a plan to get it back, she said: \'Friend,
it is so long since I have seen you. This is a day of great joy for me.
I feel very much like asking you to dance with me.\' The friend said,
\'Sister, I am feeling very happy too.\' So the two friends began to
dance together. When the weaver saw that her friend danced without
raising her hands, she said: \'Friend, let us dance with both hands
raised. This is a day of great joy.\' But the guest pressed one arm to
her side and danced raising only the</p>
<p>other. The weaver said: \'How is this, friend? Why should you dance with
only one hand raised? Dance with me raising both hands. Look at me. See
how I dance with both hands raised.\' But the guest still pressed one
arm to her side. She danced with the other hand raised and said with a
smile, \'This is all I know of dancing.\' \"</p>
<p>The Master continued: \"I don\'t press my arm to my side. Both my hands
are free. I am not afraid of anything.</p>
<p>I accept both the Nitya and the Lila, both the Absolute and the
Relative.</p>
<p><strong>The two kinds of ego</strong></p>
<p>\"I said to Keshab Sen that he would not be able to realize God without
renouncing the ego. He said, \'Sir, in that case I should not be able to
keep my organization together.\' Thereupon I said to him: \'I am asking
you to give up the \"unripe ego\", the \"wicked ego\". But there is no
harm in the \"ripe ego\", the \"child ego\", the \"servant ego\", the
\"ego of Knowledge\".\'</p>
<p>\"The worldly man\'s ego, the \'ignorant ego\', the \'unripe ego\', is
like a thick stick. It divides, as it were, the water of the Ocean of
Satchidananda. But the \'servant ego\', the \'child ego\', the \'ego of
Knowledge\', is like a line on the water. One clearly sees that there is
only one expanse of water. The dividing line makes it appear that the
water has two parts, but one clearly sees that in reality there is only
one expanse of water.</p>
<p>\"Sankaracharya kept the \'ego of Knowledge\' in order to teach people.
God keeps in many people the \'ego of a Jnāni\' or the \'ego of a
bhakta\' even after they have attained Brahmajnana. Hanuman, after
realizing God in both His Personal and His Impersonal aspect, cherished
toward God the attitude of a servant, a devotee. He said to Rāma: \'O
Rāma, sometimes I think that You are the whole and I am a part of You.
Sometimes I think that You are the Master and I am Your servant. And
sometimes, Rāma, when I contemplate the Absolute, I see that I am You
and You are I.\'</p>
<p>\"Yaśoda became grief-stricken at being separated from Krishna, and
called on Radha. Radha saw Yaśoda\'s suffering and revealed herself to
her as the divine Śakti, which was her real nature. She said to Yaśoda:
\'Krishna is Chidatma, Absolute Consciousness, and I am ChitŚakti, the
Primal Power. Ask a boon of Me: Yaśoda said: \'I don\'t want
Brahmajnana. Please grant me only this: that I may see the form of
Gopala in my meditation; that I may always have the company of
Krishna\'s devotees; that I may always serve the devotees of God; that I
may always chant God\'s name and glories.\'</p>
<p>\"Once the gopis felt a great desire to see the forms of the Lord. So
Krishna asked them to dive into the water of the Jamuna. No sooner did
they dive into the water than they all arrived at Vaikuntha. There they
saw the form of the Lord endowed with His six celestial splendours. But
they did not like it. They said to Krishna: \'We want to see Gopala and
serve Him. Please grant us that boon alone. We don\'t want anything
else.\'</p>
<p>\"Before His departure for Mathura, Krishna wanted to give the Knowledge
of Brahman to the gopis. He said to them: \'I dwell both inside and
outside all beings. Why should you see only one form of Mine?\' The
gopis cried in chorus: \'O Krishna, do You want to go away from us? Is
that why You are instructing us in Brahmajnana?\'</p>
<p>\"Do you know the attitude of the gopis? It is this: \'We are Radha\'s
and Radha is ours.\' \"</p>
<p>A DEVOTEE: \"Does this \'I\' of the devotee never disappear
altogether?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Yes, it disappears at times. Then one attains the Knowledge of
Brahman and goes into samādhi. I too lose it, but not for all the time.
In the musical scale there are seven notes: sa, re, ga, ma, pa, dha, and
ni. But one cannot keep one\'s voice on \'ni\' a long time. One must
bring it down again to the lower notes. I pray to the Divine Mother,
\'Mother, do not give me Brahmajnana.\' Formerly believers in God with
form used to visit me a great deal. Then the modern Brahmajnanis began
to arrive. During that period I used to remain unconscious in samādhi
most of the time. Whenever I regained consciousness, I would say to the
Divine Mother, \'O Mother, please don\'t give me Brahmajnana.\'\"</p>
<p><strong>God listens to our prayer</strong></p>
<p>PUNDIT: \"Does God listen to our prayers?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"God is the Kalpataru, the Wish-fulfilling Tree. You will
certainly get whatever you ask of Him. But you must pray standing near
the Kalpataru. Only then will your prayer be fulfilled. But you must
remember another thing. God knows our inner feeling. A man gets the
fulfillment of the desire he cherishes while practising sadhana. As one
thinks, so one receives. A magician was showing his tricks before a
king. Now and then he exclaimed: \'Come confusion! Come delusion! O
King, give me money! Give me clothes!\' Suddenly his tongue turned
upward and clove to the roof of his mouth. He experienced kumbhaka. He
could utter neither word nor sound, and became motionless. People
thought he was dead. They built a vault of bricks and buried him there
in that posture. After a thousand years someone dug into the vault.
Inside it people found a man seated in samādhi. They took him for a holy
man and worshipped him. When they shook him his tongue was loosened and
regained its normal position. The magician became conscious of the outer
world and cried, as he had a thousand years before: \'Come confusion!
Come delusion! O King, give me money! Give me clothes!\'</p>
<p>\"I used to weep, praying to the Divine Mother, \'O Mother, destroy with
Thy thunderbolt my inclination to reason.\' \"</p>
<p>PUNDIT: \"Then you too had an inclination to reason?\"</p>
<p>MASTER :\"Yes, once.\"</p>
<p>PUNDIT: \"Then please assure us that we shall get rid of that
inclination too. How did you get rid of yours?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Oh, somehow or other.\"</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna was silent awhile. Then he went on with his
conversation.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"God is the Kalpataru. One should pray standing near It. Then
one will get whatever one desires.</p>
<p>\"How many things God has created! Infinite is His universe. But what
need have I to know about His infinite splendours? If I must know these,
let me first realize Him. Then God Himself will tell me all about them.
What need have I to know how many houses and how many government
securities Jadu Mallick possesses? All that I need is somehow to
converse with Jadu Mallick. I may succeed in seeing him by jumping over
a ditch or through a petition or after being pushed about by his
gate-keeper. Once I get a chance to talk to him, then he himself will
tell me all about his possessions if I ask him. If one becomes
acquainted with the master, then one is respected by his officers too.
(All laugh.)</p>
<p>\"There are some who do not care to know the splendours of God. What do
I care about knowing how many gallons of wine there are in the tavern?
One bottle is enough for me. Why should I desire the knowledge of God\'s
splendours? I am intoxicated with the little wine I have swallowed.</p>
<p>\"Both bhaktiyoga and jnanayoga are paths by which you can realize God.
Whatever path you may follow, you will certainly realize Him. The path
of bhakti is an easy one. The path of knowledge and discrimination is
very difficult. Why should one reason so much to know which path is the
best? I talked about this with Vijay for many days. Once I told him
about a man who used to pray, \'O God, reveal to me who and what You
are.\'</p>
<p>\"The path of knowledge and discrimination is difficult indeed. Parvati,
the Divine Mother, revealed Her various forms to Her father and said,
\'Father, if you want Brahmajnana, then live in the company of holy
men.\'</p>
<p>\"Brahman cannot be described in words. It is said in the Rāma Gitā that
Brahman has only been indirectly hinted at by the scriptures. When one
speaks about the \'cowherd village on the Ganges\', one indirectly
states that the village is situated on the bank of the Ganges.</p>
<p>\"Why shouldn\'t a man be able to realize the formless Brahman? But it
is extremely difficult. He cannot if he</p>
<p>has even the slightest trace of worldliness. He can be directly aware of
Brahman in his inmost consciousness only when he renounces all
sense-objects―form, taste, smell, touch, and sound and only when his
mind completely stops functioning. And then too, he knows only this much
of Brahman―that It exists.\"</p>
<p>Quoting from an Upanishad, the pundit said, \"It is to be experienced
only as Existence.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"In order to realize God a devotee should make use of a
particular attitude-the attitude of a \'hero\' or a friend or a handmaid
or a child.\"</p>
<p>MANI MALLICK: \"Only then can one feel attached to God.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"For many days I cherished the feeling that I was a companion
of the Divine Mother. I used to say: \'I am the handmaid of Brahmamayi,
the Blissful Mother. O companions of the Divine Mother, make me the
Mother\'s handmaid! I shall go about proudly, saying, \"I am
Brahmamayi\'s handmaid!\" \'</p>
<p><strong>Different classes of perfect souls</strong></p>
<p>\"Some souls realize God without practising any spiritual discipline.
They are called nityasiddha, eternally perfect. Those who have realized
God through austerity, japa, and the like, are called sadhanasiddha,
perfect through spiritual discipline. Again, there are those called
kripasiddha, perfect through divine grace. These last may be compared to
a room kept dark a thousand years, which becomes light the moment a lamp
is brought in.</p>
<p>\"There is also a class of devotees, the hathatsiddha, that is to say,
those who have suddenly attained God-vision. Their case is like that of
a poor boy who has suddenly found favour with a rich man. The rich man
marries his daughter to the boy and along with her gives him land,
house, carriage, servants, and so forth.</p>
<p>\"There is still another class of devotees, the svapnasiddha, who have
had the vision of God in a dream.\"</p>
<p>SURENDRA (smiling): \"Let us go to sleep then. We shall wake and find
ourselves babus, aristocrats.\"</p>
<p>MASTER (tenderly): \"You are already a babu. When the letter \'a\' is
joined to the letter \'ka\', \'ka\' becomes \'kaa\'. It is futile to add
another \'a\'. If you add it, you will still have the same \'kaa\'. (All
laugh.)</p>
<p><strong>Description of the nitya-siddha</strong></p>
<p>\"The nityasiddha is in a class apart. He is like arani wood. A little
rubbing produces fire. You can get fire from it even without rubbing.
The nityasiddha realizes God by practising slight spiritual discipline
and sometimes without practising any at all. But he does practise
spiritual discipline after realizing God. He is like the gourd or
pumpkin vine―first fruit, then flower.\"</p>
<p>The pundit smiled at this illustration.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"There is the instance of Prahlada. He was a nityasiddha. While
writing the letter \'ka\' he shed a stream of tears.\"</p>
<p>The Master was pleased with the pundit\'s humility. He praised him to
the devotees.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"He has such a nice nature. You find no difficulty in driving a
nail into a mud wall. But its point breaks if you try to drive it
against a stone; and still it will not pierce it. There are people whose
spiritual consciousness is not at all awakened even though they hear
about God a thousand times. They are like a crocodile, on whose hide you
cannot make any impression with a sword \"</p>
<p>PUNDIT: \"But one can hurt a crocodile by throwing a spear into its
belly.\" (All laugh.)</p>
<p>MASTER (smiling): \"What good is there in reading a whole lot of
scriptures? What good is there in the study of philosophy? What is the
use of talking big? In order to learn archery one should first aim at a
banana tree,</p>
<p>then at a reed, then at a wick, and last at a flying bird. At the
beginning one should concentrate on God with form.</p>
<p>\"Then there are devotees who are beyond the three gunas. They are
eternally devoted to God, like Nārada. These devotees behold Krishna as
Chinmaya, all Spirit, His Abode as Chinmaya, His devotee as Chinmaya. To
them God is eternal, His Abode is eternal, His devotee is eternal.</p>
<p>\"Those who reason and speculate following the process of \'Neti, neti\'
do not accept the Incarnation of God. Hazra says well that Divine
Incarnation is only for the bhakta, and not for the Jnāni, because the
Jnāni is quite contented with his ideal, \'I am He\'.\"</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna and the devotees remained silent awhile. The pundit
resumed the conversation.</p>
<p>PUNDIT: \"Sir, how does one get rid of callousness? Laughter makes me
think of muscles and nerves. Grief makes me think of the nervous
system.\"</p>
<p>MASTER (smiling): \"That is why Narayan Shastri used to say, The harmful
effect of the study of the scriptures is that it encourages reasoning
and arguing.\'\"</p>
<p>PUNDIT: \"Is there no way for us then?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Yes, there is the path of discrimination. In a song occurs the
line: \'Ask her son Discrimination about the Truth.\'</p>
<p>\"The way lies through discrimination, renunciation, and passionate
yearning for God. Unless a man practises discrimination, he cannot utter
the right words. One time, after expounding religion at great length,
Pundit Samadhyayi said, \'God is dry.\' He reminded me of the man who
once said, \'My uncle\'s cow-shed is full of horses.\' Now, does anyone
keep horses in a cowshed? (With a smile) You have become like a
chānābarā fried in butter. Now it will be good for you and for others as
well, if you are soaked in syrup a few days. Just a few days.\"</p>
<p>PUNDIT (smiling): \"The sweetmeat is over-fried. It has become
charred.\"</p>
<p>MASTER (with a laugh): \"No! No! It is brown as a cockroach. Just the
right colour.\"</p>
<p>HAZRA: \"The sweetmeat is well cooked. It has become spongy. Now it will
soak up the syrup nicely.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"You see, there is no need to read too much of the scriptures.
If you read too much you will be</p>
<p>inclined to reason and argue. Nangta used to teach me thus: What you get
by repeating the word \'Gitā\' tell times is the essence of the book. In
other words, if you repeat \'Gitā\' ten times it is reversed into
\'tagi\', which indicates renunciation.</p>
<p>\"Yes, the way to realize God is through discrimination, renunciation,
and yearning for Him. What kind of yearning? One should yearn for God as
the cow, with yearning heart, runs after its calf.\"</p>
<p>PUNDIT: \"The same thing is said in the Vedas: \'O God, we call on Thee
as the cow lows for the calf.\'\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Add your tears to your yearning. And if you can renounce
everything through discrimination and dispassion, then you will be able
to see God. That yearning brings about God-intoxication, whether you
follow the path of knowledge or the path of devotion. The sage Durvasa
was mad with the Knowledge of God.</p>
<p>\"There is a great deal of difference between the knowledge of a
householder and that of an all-renouncing sannyasi. The householder\'s
knowledge is like the light of a lamp, which illumines only the inside
of a room. He cannot see anything, with the help of such knowledge,
except his own body and his immediate family. But the knowledge of the
all-renouncing monk is like the light of the sun. Through that light he
can see both, inside</p>
<p>and outside the room. Chaitanyadeva\'s knowledge had the brilliance of
the sun-the sun of Knowledge. Further, he radiated the soothing light of
the moon of Devotion. He was endowed with both-the Knowledge of Brahman
and ecstatic love of God.</p>
<p>(To the pundit) \"One can attain spiritual consciousness through both
affirmation and negation. There is the positive path of love and
devotion, and there is the negative path of knowledge and
discrimination. You are preaching the path of knowledge. But that
creates a very difficult situation: there the guru and the disciple do
not see each other. Sukadeva went to Janaka for instruction about the
Knowledge of Brahman. Janaka said to him: \'You must pay me the guru\'s
fee beforehand. When you attain the knowledge of Brahman you won\'t pay
me the fee, because the knower of Brahman sees no difference between the
guru and the disciple.\'</p>
<p><strong>Different stages of divine love</strong></p>
<p>\"Both negation and affirmation are ways to realize one and the same
goal. Infinite are the opinions and infinite are the ways. But you must
remember one thing. The injunction is that the path of devotion
described by Nārada is best suited to the Kaliyuga. According to this
path, first comes bhakti; then bhava, when bhakti is mature. Higher than
bhava are mahabhava and prema. An ordinary mortal does not attain
mahabhava and prema. He who has achieved these has realized the goal,
that is to say, has attained God.\"</p>
<p>PUNDIT : \"In expounding religion one has to use a great many words.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"While preaching, eliminate the \'head and tail\', that is to
say, emphasize only the essentials.\"</p>
<p>The pundit and Mani Mallick became engaged in conversation. Mani was a
member of the Brahmo Samaj. The pundit argued vehemently about the good
and bad sides of the Samaj. Sri Ramakrishna was seated on the small
couch and looked on, smiling. Presently he remarked: \"This is the
tamasic aspect of sattva, the attitude of a hero. This is necessary. One
should not hold one\'s tongue at the sight of injustice and untruth.
Suppose a bad woman wants to drag you from the path of righteousness.
You must then assume the heroic attitude and say: \'What? You witch! You
dare injure my spiritual life? I shall cut your body in two right now.\'
\"</p>
<p>With a smile Sri Ramakrishna said to the pundit: \"Mani Mallick has been
following the tenets of the Brahmo Samaj a long time. You can\'t convert
him to your views. Is it an easy thing to destroy old tendencies? Once
there lived a very pious Hindu who always worshipped the Divine Mother
and chanted Her name. When the Mussalmans conquered the country, they
forced him embrace Islam. They said to him: \'You are now a Mussalman.
Say \"Allah\". From now on you must repeat only the name of Allah.\'
With great difficulty he repeated the word \'Allah\', but every now and
then blurted out \'Jagadamba\'. At that the Mussalmans were about to
beat him. Thereupon he said to them: \'I beseech you! Please do not kill
me. I have been trying my utmost to repeat the name of Allah, but our
Jagadamba has filled me up to the throat. She pushes out your Allah.\'
(All laugh.)</p>
<p><strong>Different paths to suit different tastes</strong></p>
<p>(To the pundit) \"Please don\'t say anything to Mani Mallick. You must
know that there are different tastes. There are also different powers of
digestion. God has made different religions and creeds to suit different
aspirants. By no means all are fit for the Knowledge of Brahman.
Therefore the worship of God with form has been provided.</p>
<p>\"The mother brings home a fish for her children. She curries part of
the fish, part she fries, and with another part she makes pilau. By no
means all can digest the pilau. So she makes fish soup for those who
have weak stomachs. Further, some want pickled or fried fish. There are
different temperaments. There are differences in the capacity to
comprehend.\"</p>
<p>All sat in silence. Sri Ramakrishna said to the pundit, \"Go and visit
the temples and take a stroll in the garden.\" It was about half past
five in the afternoon. The pundit left the room with his friends and
several of the devotees.</p>
<p>After a while the Master went with M. toward the bathing-ghat on the
Ganges. He said to M., \"Baburam now says, \'What shall I gain by
study?\' \" On the bank of the river he met the pundit and said to him,
\"Aren\'t you going to the Kāli temple?\" The pundit said: \"Yes, sir.
Let us go together.\" With a smiling face Sri Ramakrishna proceeded to
the temple through the courtyard. He said to the pundit, \"Listen to a
song.\"</p>
<p>He sang:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Is Kāli, my Mother, really black?</em></p>
<p><em>The Naked One, of blackest hue,</em></p>
<p><em>Lights the Lotus of the Heart. . . .</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As he was going through the courtyard, he quoted to the pundit from a
song:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Lighting the lamp of Knowledge in the chamber of your heart, Behold
the face of the Mother, Brahman\'s Embodiment.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>They came to the temple. Sri Ramakrishna saluted the Divine Mother,
touching the ground with his forehead.</p>
<p>Red hibiscus flowers and vilwa-leaves adorned the Mother\'s feet. Her
three eyes radiated love for Her devotees. Two of Her hands were raised
as if to give them boons and reassurance; the other two hands held
symbols of death. She was clothed in a sari of Benares silk and was
decked with ornaments.</p>
<p><strong>Image of Kāli</strong></p>
<p>Referring to the image, one of the party remarked, \"I heard it was made
by the sculptor Nabin.\" The Master answered: \"Yes, I know. But to me
She is the Embodiment of Spirit.\"</p>
<p>As Sri Ramakrishna was coming back to his room with the devotees, he
said to Baburam, \"Come with us.\" M.</p>
<p>also joined them.</p>
<p>It was dusk. The Master was sitting on the semicircular porch west of
his room. Baburam and M. sat near him.</p>
<p>He was in a mood of partial ecstasy.</p>
<p>Rākhāl was not then living with Sri Ramakrishna, and therefore the
Master was having difficulties about his personal service. Several
devotees lived with him, but he could not bear the touch of everyone
during his spiritual moods. He hinted to Baburam: \"Do stay with me. It
will be very nice. In this mood I cannot allow others to touch me.\"</p>
<p>The pundit entered the Master\'s room after visiting the temples. The
Master said to him from the porch, \"Take some refreshments.\" The
pundit said that he had not yet performed his evening devotions. At once
Sri Ramakrishna stood up and sang in an exalted mood:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Why should I go to Ganga or Gaya, to Kasi, Kanchi, or Prabhas,</em></p>
<p><em>So long as I can breathe my last with Kāli\'s name upon my lips?</em></p>
<p><em>What need of rituals has a man, what need of devotions any more,</em></p>
<p><em>If he repeats the Mother\'s name at the three holy hours? . . .</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Intoxicated With ecstatic love, the Master said: \"How long should one
perform devotions? So long as one\'s mind does not merge in God while
repeating Om.\"</p>
<p>PUNDIT: \"Then let me eat the refreshments. I shall perform the
devotions later on.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"No, I don\'t want to obstruct the current of your life. It is
not good to renounce anything before the proper time arrives. When the
fruit ripens, the flower drops off of itself. One shouldn\'t forcibly
tear off the green branch of a coconut tree. That injures the tree.\"</p>
<p>Surendra was about to leave. He invited his friends into his carriage.
The Master, still in an ecstatic mood,</p>
<p>said, \"Don\'t take more people than your horse can draw.\" Suredra took
leave of Sri Ramakrishna. The pundit left the room to perform his
worship. M. and Baburam saluted the Master. They were about to leave for
Calcutta. Sri Ramakrishna was still in an ecstatic mood.</p>
<p>MASTER (to M.): \"I cannot utter a word now. Stay a few minutes.\"</p>
<p>M. again took his seat and waited for the Master\'s command. Sri
Ramakrishna motioned to Baburam to take a seat and asked him to fan him
a little. M. also took part in rendering this personal service to the
Master.</p>
<p>MASTER (to M., tenderly): \"Why don\'t you come here so frequently
now?\"</p>
<p>M: \"Not for any special reason. I have been rather busy at home.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Yesterday I came to know Baburam\'s inner nature. That is why
I have been trying so hard to persuade him to live with me. The mother
bird hatches the egg in proper time. Boys like Baburam are pure in
heart. They have not yet fallen into the clutches of \'woman and gold\'.
Isn\'t that so?\"</p>
<p>M: \"It is true, sir. They are still stainless.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"They are like a new pot. Milk kept in it will not turn sour.\"</p>
<p>M: \"Yes, sir.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"I need Baburam here. I pass through certain spiritual states
when I need someone like him. He says he must not, all at once, live
with me permanently, for it will create difficulties. His relatives will
make trouble. I am asking him to come here Saturdays and Sundays.\"</p>
<p><strong>Master\'s advice to householders</strong></p>
<p>The pundit entered the room with his friends. He had finished his
devotions and was ready to eat the refreshments. One of his companions
asked the Master: \"Shall we succeed in spiritual life? Please tell us
what our way is.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"You all have the yearning for liberation. If an aspirant has
yearning, that is enough for him to realize God. Don\'t eat any food of
the sraaddha ceremony. Live in the world like an unchaste woman. She
performs her household duties with great attention, but her mind dwells
day and night on her paramour. Perform your duties in the world but keep
your mind always fixed on God.</p>
<p>The pundit finished eating his refreshments.</p>
<p>MASTER (to the pundit): \"You have read the Gitā, no doubt. It says that
there is a special power of God in the man who is honoured and respected
by all.\"</p>
<p>The pundit quoted the verse from the Gitā.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"You surely possess divine power.\"</p>
<p>PUNDIT: \"Shall I labour with perseverance to finish the task that I
have accepted?\"</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna forced himself, as it were, to say, \"Yes.\" He soon
changed the conversation.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"One cannot but admit the manifestation of power. Vidyasagar
once asked me, \'Has God given more power to some than to others?\' I
said to him: \'Certainly. Otherwise, how can one man kill a hundred? If
there is no special manifestation of power, then why is Queen Victoria
so much honoured and respected? Don\'t you admit it?\' He agreed with
me.\"</p>
<p>The pundit and his friends saluted the Master and were about to take
their leave. Sri Ramakrishna said to the</p>
<p>pundit: \"Come again. One hemp-smoker rejoices in the company of another
hemp-smoker. They even embrace each other. But they hide at the sight of
people not of their own kind. A cow licks the body of her calf; but she
threatens a strange cow with her horns.\" (All laugh.)</p>
<p>The pundit left the room. With a smile the Master said: \"He has become
\'diluted\' even in one day. Did you notice how modest he was? And he
accepted everything I said.\"</p>
<p>Moonlight flooded the semicircular porch. Sri Ramakrishna was still
seated there. M. was about to leave.</p>
<p>MASTER (tenderly): \"Must you go now?\"</p>
<p>M.: \"Yes, sir. Let me say good-bye.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"I have been thinking of visiting the houses of the devotees. I
want to visit yours also. What do you say?\"</p>
<p>M.: \"That will be very fine.\"</p>
<p><strong>Thursday, July 3, 1884</strong></p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna was sitting in Balarām Bose\'s house in Calcutta. It was
the day of the \"Return Car Festival\". The Lord of the Universe was
worshipped in Balarām\'s house as Jagannath. There was a small car in
the house for use during the Car Festival.</p>
<p><strong>Balarām\'s father</strong></p>
<p>Balarām\'s father was a pious Vaishnava who devoted most of his time to
prayer and meditation in his garden house at Vrindāvan. He also studied
devotional books and enjoyed the company of devotees. Balarām had
brought his father to Calcutta to meet the Master.</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna was in a very happy mood. Seated near him were Ram,
Balarām, Balarām\'s father, M., Manomohan, and several young devotees.
He was conversing with them.</p>
<p><strong>Dogmatism in religion</strong></p>
<p>MASTER (to Balarām\'s father and the others): \"The Bhaktamala is one of
the Vaishnava books. It is a fine book. It describes the lives of the
various Vaishnava devotees. But it is one-sided. At one place the author
found peace of mind only after compelling Bhagavati, the Divine Mother,
to take Her initiation according to the Vaishnava discipline.</p>
<p>\"Once I spoke highly of Vaishnavcharan to Mathur and persuaded him to
invite Vaishnavcharan to his house. Mathur welcomed him with great
courtesy. He fed his guest from silver plates. Then do you know what
happened? Vaishnav said in front of Mathur, \'You will achieve nothing
whatsoever in spiritual life unless you accept Krishna as your Ideal.\'
Mathur was a follower of the Sakta cult and a worshipper of the Divine
Mother. At once his face became crimson. I nudged Vaishnavcharan.</p>
<p>\"I understand that the Bhagavata also contains some statements like
that. I hear that it is said there that trying to cross the ocean of the
world without accepting Krishna as the Ideal Deity is like trying to
cross a great sea by holding the tail of a dog. Each sect magnifies its
own view.</p>
<p>\"The Saktas, too, try to belittle the Vaishnavas. The Vaishnavas say
that Krishna alone is the Helmsman to take one across the ocean of the
world. The Saktas retort: \'Oh, yes! We agree to that. Our Divine Mother
is the Empress of the Universe. Why should She bother about a
ferry-boat? Therefore She has engaged that fellow Krishna for the
purpose.\' (All laugh.)</p>
<p>\"Besides, how vain people are about their own sects! There are weavers
in the villages near Kamarpukur. Many</p>
<p>of them are Vaishnavas and like to talk big. They say: \'Which Vishnu
does he worship? The Preserver? Oh, we wouldn\'t touch him!\' Or:
\'Which Śiva are you talking about? We accept the Atmaramasiva.\' Or
again, \'Please explain to us which Hari you worship\'. They spin their
yarn and indulge in talk like that.</p>
<p>\"Rati\'s mother, Rani Katyayani\'s favourite confidante, is a follower
of Vaishnavcharan. She is a bigoted Vaishnava. She used to visit me very
frequently, and none could outdo her in devotion. One day she noticed me
eating the prasad from the Kāli temple. Since then I haven\'t seen even
her shadow.</p>
<p><strong>Master\'s harmony of religions</strong></p>
<p>\"He is indeed a real man who has harmonized everything. Most people are
one-sided. But I find that all opinions point to the One. All views-the
Sakta, the Vaishnava, the Vedānta-have that One for their centre. He who
is formless is, again, endowed with form. It is He who appears in
different forms: The attributeless Brahman is my Father. God with
attributes is my Mother. Whom shall I blame? Whom shall I praise? The
two pans of the scales are equally heavy.\'</p>
<p>\"He who is described in the Vedas is also described in the Tantras and
the Puranas. All of them speak about the one Satchidananda. The Nitya
and the Lila are the two aspects of the one Reality. It is described in
the Vedas as \'Om Satchidananda Brahman\', in the Tantras as \'Om
Satchidananda Śiva\', the ever-pure Śiva, and in the Puranas as \'Om
Satchidananda Krishna\'. All the scriptures, the Vedas, the Puranas, and
the Tantras, speak only of one Satchidananda. It is stated in the
Vaishnava scripture that it is Krishna Himself who has become Kāli.\"</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna went to the porch for a few minutes and then returned.
As he was going out, Vishvamvhar\'s daughter, six or seven years old,
saluted him. On returning to the room, the Master began talking to the
little girl and her companions, who were of the same age.</p>
<p>THE CHILD (to the Master): \"I saluted you and you didn\'t even notice
it.\"</p>
<p>MASTER (smiling): \"Did you? I really didn\'t notice.\"</p>
<p>CHILD: \"Then wait. I want to salute you again-the other foot too.\"</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna laughed and sat down. He returned the salute and bowed
to the child, touching the ground with his forehead. He asked her to
sing. The child said, \"I.swear I don\'t sing.\" When the Master pressed
her again, she said, \"Should you press me when I said \'I swear\'?\"
The Master was very happy with the children and sang light and frivolous
songs to entertain them. He sang:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Come, let me braid your hair,</em></p>
<p><em>Lest your husband should scold you</em></p>
<p><em>When he beholds you!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The children and the devotees laughed.</p>
<p><strong>Childlike nature of a Paramahamsa</strong></p>
<p>MASTER (to the devotees): \"The paramahamsa is like a five-year-old
child. He sees everything filled with Consciousness. At one time I was
staying at Kamarpukur when Shivaram was four or five years old. One day
he was trying to catch grasshoppers near the pond. The leaves were
moving. To stop their rustling he said to the leaves: \'Hush! Hush! I
want to catch a grasshopper.\' Another day it was stormy. It rained
hard. Shivaram was with me inside the house. There were flashes of
lightning. He wanted to open the door and go out. I scolded him and
stopped him, but still he peeped out now and then. When he saw the
lightning he exclaimed, \'There, uncle! They are striking matches
again!\'</p>
<p>\"The paramahamsa is like a child. He cannot distinguish between a
stranger and a relative. He isn\'t particular about worldly
relationships. One day Shivaram said to me, \'Uncle, are you my
father\'s brother or his brother-</p>
<p>in-law?\'</p>
<p>\"The paramahamsa is like a child. He doesn\'t keep any track of his
whereabouts. He sees everything as Brahman. He is indifferent to his own
movements. Shivaram went to Hriday\'s house to see the Durga Puja. He
slipped out of the house and wandered away. A passer-by saw the child,
who was then only four years old, and asked, \'Where do you come from?\'
He couldn\'t say much. He only said the word \'hut\'. He was speaking of
the big hut in which the image of the Divine Mother was being
worshipped. The stranger asked him further, \'Whom are you living
with?\' He only said the word \'brother\'.</p>
<p><strong>Other traits of a Paramahamsa</strong></p>
<p>\"Sometimes the paramahamsa behaves like a madman. When I experienced
that divine madness I used to worship my own sexual organ as the
Śiva-phallus. But I. can\'t do that now. A few days after the dedication
of the temple at Dakshineswar, a madman came there who was really a sage
endowed with the Knowledge of Brahman. He had a bamboo twig in one hand
and a potted mango-plant in the other, and was wearing torn shoes. He
didn\'t follow any social conventions. After bathing in the Ganges he
didn\'t perform any religious rites. He ate something that he carried in
a corner of his wearing-cloth. Then he entered the Kāli temple and
chanted hymns to the Deity. The temple trembled. Haladhāri was then in
the shrine. The madman wasn\'t allowed to eat at the guest-house, but he
paid no attention to this slight. He searched for food in the rubbish
heap where the dogs were eating crumbs from the discarded leaf-plates.
Now and then he pushed the dogs aside to get his crumbs. The dogs
didn\'t mind either. Haladhāri followed him and asked: \'Who are you?
Are you a purnajnani?\' The madman whispered, \'Sh! Yes, I am a
purnajnani.\' My heart began to palpitate as Haladhāri told me about it.
I clung to Hriday. I said to the Divine Mother, \'Mother, shall I too
have to pass through such a state?\' We all went to see the man. He
spoke words of great wisdom to us but behaved like a madman before
others. Haladhāri followed him a great way when he left the garden.
After passing the gate he said to Haladhāri: \'What else shall I say to
you? When you no longer make any distinction between the water of this
pool and the water of the Ganges, then you will know that you have
Perfect Knowledge.\' Saying this he walked rapidly away.\"</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna began to talk with M. Other devotees, too, were present.</p>
<p>MASTER (to M.): \"How do you feel about Shashadhar?\"</p>
<p>M: \"He is very nice.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"He is very intelligent, isn\'t he?\"</p>
<p>M: \"Yes, sir. He is very erudite.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"According to the Gitā there is a power of God in one who is
respected and honoured by many. But Shashadhar has still a few things to
do.</p>
<p>What will he accomplish with mere scholarship? He needs to practise some
austerity. It is necessary to practise some spiritual discipline.</p>
<p>\"Gauri Pundit practised austerity. When he chanted a hymn to the Divine
Mother, the other pundits would seem no more than earthworms.</p>
<p>\"Narayan Shastri was not merely a scholar, either. He practised sadhana
as well. He studied for twenty-five years without a break. Nyaya alone,
he studied for seven years. Still he would go into ecstasy while
repeating the name of Śiva. The King of Jaipur wanted to make him his
court pundit, but Narayan refused. He used to spend much time here. He
had a great desire to go to the Vasishtha Āśrama to practise tapasya. He
often spoke to me about it, but I forbade him to go there. At that he
said: \'Who knows when I shall die? When shall I practise sadhana? Any
day I may crack.\' After much insistence on his part I let him go. Some
say that he is dead, that he died while practising austerity. Others say
that he is still alive and that they saw him off on a</p>
<p>railway train.</p>
<p><strong>Master and Keshab</strong></p>
<p>\"Before meeting Keshab, I asked Narayan Shastri to visit him and tell
me what he thought of him. Narayan reported that Keshab was an adept in
japa. He knew astrology and remarked that Keshab had been born under a
good star. Then I went to visit Keshab in the garden house at Belgharia.
Hriday was with me. The moment I saw Keshab, I said: \'Of all the people
I see here, he alone has dropped his tail. He can now live on land as
well as in water, like a frog.\'</p>
<p>\"Keshab sent three members of the Brahmo Samaj to the temple garden at
Dakshineswar to test me. Prasanna was one of them. They were
commissioned to watch me day and night, and to report to Keshab. They
were in my room and intended to spend the night there. They constantly
uttered the word \'Dayamaya\' and said to me: \'Follow Keshab Babu. That
will do you good.\' I said, \'I believe in God with form.\' Still they
went on with their exclamations of \'Dayamaya!\' Then a strange mood
came over me. I said to them, \'Get out of here!\' I didn\'t allow them
to spend the night in my room. So they slept on the verandah. Captain
also spent the night in the temple garden the first time he visited me.</p>
<p>\"Michael visited the temple garden when Narayan Shastri was living with
me. Dwarika Babu, Mathur\'s eldest son, brought him here. The owners of
the temple garden were about to get into a lawsuit with the English
proprietors of the neighbouring powder magazine; so they wanted
Michael\'s advice. I met him in the big room next to the manager\'s
office. Narayan Shastri was with me. I asked Narayan to talk to him.
Michael couldn\'t talk very well in Sanskrit. He made mistakes. Then
they talked in the popular dialect. Narayan Shastri asked him his reason
for giving up the Hindu religion. Pointing to his stomach, Michael said,
\'It was for this.\' Narayan said, \'What shall I say to a man who gives
up his religion for his belly\'s sake?\' Thereupon Michael asked me to
say something. I said: \'I don\'t know why, but I don\'t feel like
saying anything. Someone seems to be pressing my tongue.\' \"</p>
<p>MANOMOHAN: \"Mr. Choudhury will not come. He said: \'That fellow
Shashadhar from Faridpur will be there. I shall not go.\' \"</p>
<p>Mr. Choudhury had obtained his Master\'s degree from Calcutta
University. He drew a salary of three or four hundred rupees. After the
death of his first wife he had felt intense dispassion for the world,
but after some time he had married again. He frequently visited the
Master at the temple garden.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"How mean of him! He is vain of his scholarship. Besides, he
has married a second time. He looks on the world as a mere mud-puddle.</p>
<p>(To the devotees) \"This attachment to \'woman and gold\' makes a man
small-minded. When I first saw Haramohan he had many good traits. I
longed to see him. He was then seventeen or eighteen years old. I used
to send for him every now and then, but he wouldn\'t come. He is now
living away from the family with his wife. He had been living with his
uncle before. That was very good. He had no worldly troubles. Now he has
a separate home and does the marketing for his wife daily. The other day
he came to Dakshineswar. I said to him: \'Go away. Leave this place. I
don\'t even feel like touching you.\' \"</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna went to the inner apartments to see the Deity. He
offered some flowers. The ladies of Balarām\'s family were pleased to
see him.</p>
<p>The Master came back to the drawing-room and said: \"The worldly minded
practise devotions, japa, and austerity only by fits and starts. But
those who know nothing else but God repeat His name with every breath.
Some always repeat mentally, \'Om Rāma\'. Even the followers of the path
of knowledge repeat, \'Soham\', \'I am He\'. There are others whose
tongues are always moving, repeating the name of God. One should
remember and think of God constantly.\"</p>
<p>Pundit Shashadhar entered the room with one or two friends and saluted
the Master.</p>
<p>MASTER (smiling): \"We are like the bridesmaids waiting near the bed for
the arrival of the groom.\"</p>
<p>The pundit laughed. The room was filled with devotees, among them
Dr.Pratap and Balarām\'s father. The Master continued his talk.</p>
<p>MASTER (to Shashadhar): \"The first sign of knowledge is a peaceful
nature, and the second is absence of egotism. You have both. There are
other indications of a Jnāni. He shows intense dispassion in the
presence of a sādhu, is a lion when at work, for instance, when he
lectures, and is full of wit before his wife. (All laugh.)</p>
<p>\"But the nature of the vijnāni is quite different, as was the case with
Chaitanyadeva. He acts like a child or a madman or an inert thing or a
ghoul. While in the mood of a child, he sometimes shows childlike
guilelessness, sometimes the frivolity of adolescence, and sometimes,
while instructing others, the strength of a young man.\"</p>
<p><strong>Three kinds of bhakti</strong></p>
<p>PUNDIT: \"By what kind of bhakti does one realize God?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Three kinds of bhakti are found, according to the nature of
the man: sattvic bhakti, rajasic bhakti, and tamasic bhakti.</p>
<p>\"Sattvic bhakti is known to God alone. It makes no outward display. A
man with such devotion loves privacy. Perhaps he meditates inside the
mosquito net, where nobody sees him. When this kind of devotion is
awakened, one hasn\'t long to wait for the vision of God. The appearance
of the dawn in the east shows that the sun will rise before long.</p>
<p>\"A man with rajasic bhakti feels like making a display of his devotion
before others. He worships the Deity with \'sixteen ingredients\',
enters the temple wearing a silk cloth, and puts around his neck a
string of rudrāksha beads interspersed here and there with beads of gold
and ruby.</p>
<p>\"A man with tamasic bhakti shows the courage and boisterousness of a
highway robber. A highway robber goes on his expedition openly,
shouting, \'Kill! Plunder!\' He isn\'t afraid even of eight police
inspectors. The devotee with tamasic bhakti also shouts like a
madman:\'Hara! Hara! Vyom! Vyom! Victory to Kāli!\' He has great
strength of mind and burning faith.</p>
<p>\"A Sakta has such faith. He says: \'What? I have uttered once the name
of Kāli and of Durga! I have uttered once the name of Rāma! Can there be
any sin in me?\'</p>
<p>\"The Vaishnavas have a very humble and lowly attitude. (Looking at
Balarām\'s father) They tell their rosary and whine and whimper: \'O
Krishna, be gracious to us! We are wretched! We are sinners!\'</p>
<p><strong>Faith in God\'s name</strong></p>
<p>\"A man should have such fiery faith as to be able to say, \'I have
uttered the name of God; how can I be a sinner?\' Imagine a man
repeating the name of Hari day and night and at the same time saying
that he is a sinner!\"</p>
<p>So saying, Sri Ramakrishna became overwhelmed with divine ecstasy and
sang:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>If only I can pass away repeating Durga\'s name,</em></p>
<p><em>How canst Thou then, O Blessed One,</em></p>
<p><em>Withhold from me deliverance,</em></p>
<p><em>Wretched though I may be?</em></p>
<p><em>I may have stolen a drink of wine, or killed a child unborn,</em></p>
<p><em>Or slain a woman or a cow,</em></p>
<p><em>Or even caused a brahmin\'s death;</em></p>
<p><em>But, though it all be true,</em></p>
<p><em>Nothing of this can make me feel the least uneasiness;</em></p>
<p><em>For through the power of Thy sweet name</em></p>
<p><em>My wretched soul may still aspire</em></p>
<p><em>Even to Brahmanhood.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He sang again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Behold my Mother playing with Śiva, lost in an ecstasy of joy!</em></p>
<p><em>Drunk with a draught of celestial wine, She reels, and yet She does
not fall.</em></p>
<p><em>Erect She stands on Śiva\'s bosom, and the earth trembles under Her
tread;</em></p>
<p><em>She and Her Lord are mad with frenzy, casting aside all fear and
shame!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pundit Shashadhar was weeping. Vaishnavcharan, the musician, sang:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>O tongue, always repeat the name of Mother Durga!</em></p>
<p><em>Who but your Mother Durga will save you in distress?</em></p>
<p><em>Thou art the heavens and the earth, and Thou the nether world;</em></p>
<p><em>From Thee have the twelve Gopalas and Hari and Śiva sprung.</em></p>
<p><em>The ten Embodiments of Divine Śakti art Thou,</em></p>
<p><em>And Thou the ten Avatars: this time, save me Thou must!</em></p>
<p><em>The moving and the unmoving, the gross and the subtle, art Thou;</em></p>
<p><em>Creation and preservation art Thou, and the last dissolution.</em></p>
<p><em>Thou art the Primal Root of this manifold universe;</em></p>
<p><em>The Mother of the three worlds, their only Saviour, art Thou;</em></p>
<p><em>Thou art the Śakti of all, and Thou Thine own Śakti, too.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the Master listened to the last few lines, he went into an ecstatic
mood. The Master himself sang:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Mother, for Yaśoda Thou wouldst dance, when she called Thee her
    &gt; precious \"Blue Jewel\";</em></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Where hast Thou hidden that lovely form, O terrible Syama?</em></p>
<p><em>Dance that way once for me, O Mother! Throw down Thy sword and take
the flute; Cast off Thy garland of heads, and wear Thy wild-flower
garland.</em></p>
<p><em>If without Śiva Thou canst not dance, then let Balarama be Thy Śiva.
Dance, O Syama, as Thou didst dance when Thou wast Krishna! Mother,
play on Thy flute again, once so full of delight for the gopis; Play
again on Thy magic flute, which called the cattle in from the pasture,
Stopping the Jamuna\'s murmuring flow and turning it backward.</em></p>
<p><em>Hot in the sky the sun would burn, when Yaśoda, restless for her
Krishna, Fondly would call: \"Here, my Gopala! Cream and butter-eat
them, my Darling!\" And she would comb His long black hair and
carefully braid it.</em></p>
<p><em>Bending Thy supple body, Mother, both at the neck, the waist, and the
knee,</em></p>
<p><em>Thou didst dance with Thy friend Sridāmā, while Thy two anklets
played the music: Ta-thaia! Ta-thaia! Ta-ta! Thaia-thaia!</em></p>
<p><em>Hearing their captivating sound, the gopis would rush there.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again Pundit Shashadhar shed tears of love.</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna came down to consciousness of the world. Pointing to
Shashadhar, he said to M., \"Why don\'t you prod him?\" He wanted M. or
some other devotee to ask Shashadhar a question.</p>
<p>RAMDAYAL (to Shashadhar): \"The scriptures speak of Brahman\'s form as a
projection of mind. Who is it that projects?\"</p>
<p>SHASHADHAR: \"It is Brahman Itself that does so. It is no projection of
a man\'s mind.\"</p>
<p>PRATAP: \"Why does Brahman project the form?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"You ask why? Brahman doesn\'t act in consultation with others.
It is Brahman\'s pleasure. Brahman is self-willed. Why should we try to
know the reason for Brahman\'s acting this way or that? You have come to
the orchard to eat mangoes. Eat the mangoes. What is the good of
calculating how many trees there are in the orchard, how many thousands
of branches, and how many millions of leaves? One cannot realize Truth
by futile arguments and reasoning.\"</p>
<p>PRATAP: \"Shouldn\'t we reason any more then?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"I am asking you not to indulge in futile reasoning. But
reason, by all means, about the Real and the unreal, about what is
permanent and what is transitory. You must reason when you are overcome
by lust, anger, or grief.\"</p>
<p>SHASHADHAR: \"That is different. It is called reasoning based on
discrimination.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Yes, discrimination between the Real and the unreal.\"</p>
<p>All sat in silence. Again the Master spoke, addressing the pundit.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Formerly many great men used to come here.\"</p>
<p>SHASHADHAR: \"You mean rich people?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"No. Great scholars.\"</p>
<p>In the mean time the small car of Jagannath had been brought to the
verandah. Inside the car were the images of Krishna, Balarama, and
Subhadra. They were adorned with flowers, garlands, jewelry, and yellow
apparel. Balarām was a sattvic worshipper: there was no outward grandeur
in his worship. Outsiders did not even know of this Car Festival at his
house. The Master and the devotees went to the verandah. Sri Ramakrishna
pulled the car by the rope. Then he began to sing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>See how all Nadia is shaking</em></p>
<p><em>Under the waves of Gaurānga\'s love. . . .</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He sang again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Behold, the two brothers have come, who weep while chanting Hari\'s
name, The brothers who, in return for blows, offer to sinners Hari\'s
love. . . .</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna danced with the devotees. The musician and his party
joined the Master in the music and dancing. Soon the whole verandah was
filled with people. The ladies witnessed this scene of joy from an
adjoining room. It appeared as if Chaitanya himself were dancing with
his devotees, intoxicated with divine love.</p>
<p>It was not yet dusk. Sri Ramakrishna returned to the drawing-room with
the devotees.</p>
<p>MASTER (to Shashadhar): \"This is called bhajanananda, the bliss of
devotees in the worship of God. Worldly people keep themselves engrossed
in the joy of sensuous objects, of \'woman and gold\'. Through worship
devotees receive the grace of God, and then His vision. Then they enjoy
Brahmananda, the Bliss of Brahman.\"</p>
<p>Shashadhar and the devotees listened to these words with rapt attention.</p>
<p>SHASHADHAR (humbly): \"Sir, please tell us what kind of yearning gives
one this blissful state of mind.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"One feels restless for God when one\'s soul longs for His
vision. The guru said to the disciple: \'Come with me. I shall show you
what kind of longing will enable you to see God.\' Saying this, he took
the disciple to a pond and pressed his head under the water. After a few
moments he released the disciple and asked, \'How did you feel?\' The
disciple answered: \'Oh, I felt as if I were dying! I was longing for a
breath of air.\' \"</p>
<p>SHASHADHAR: \"Yes! Yes! That\'s it. I understand it now.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"To love God is the essence of the whole thing. Bhakti alone is
the essence. Nārada said to Rāma, \'May I always have pure love for Your
Lotus Feet; and may I not be deluded by Your world-bewitching māyā!\'
Rāma said to him, \'Ask for some other boon.\' \'No,\' said Nārada, \'I
don\'t want anything else. May I have love for Your Lotus Feet. This is
my only prayer.\' \"</p>
<p>Pundit Shashadhar was ready to leave. Sri Ramakrishna asked a devotee to
bring a carriage for the pundit.</p>
<p>SHASHADHAR: \"Don\'t trouble yourself. I shall walk.\"</p>
<p>MASTER (smiling): \"Oh, how can that be? \'You are beyond the reach of
even Brahma\'s meditation.\' \"</p>
<p>SHASHADHAR: \"There is no particular need of my going just now. The only
thing is that I shall have to perform my sandhya.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"The Divine Mother has taken away my sandhya and other
devotions. The purpose of the sandhya is to purify body and mind. I am
no longer in that state.\"</p>
<p>The Master sang the following lines of a song:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>When will you learn to lie, O mind, in the abode of Blessedness,</em></p>
<p><em>With Cleanliness and Defilement on either side of you?</em></p>
<p><em>Only when you have found the way</em></p>
<p><em>To keep these wives contentedly under a single roof,</em></p>
<p><em>Will you behold the matchless form of Mother Syama.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pundit Shashadhar saluted the Master and went away.</p>
<p>RAM: \"I visited Shashadhar yesterday. You asked me to.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Did I? I don\'t remember. But it is nice that you went.\"</p>
<p>RAM: \"The editor of a newspaper was abusing you.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Suppose he was. What does it matter?\"</p>
<p>RAM: \"Please listen. Then I began to talk to the editor about you. He
wanted to hear more and wouldn\'t let me go.\"</p>
<p>It was dusk. Sri Ramakrishna began to chant the names of the Divine
Mother, Krishna, Rāma, and Hari. The devotees sat in silence. The Master
chanted the names in such sweet tones that the hearts of the devotees
were deeply touched. That day Balarām\'s house was like Navadvip when
Chaitanya lived there. On the verandah it was like Navadvip, and in the
parlour it was like Vrindāvan.</p>
<p>That same night Sri Ramakrishna was to go to Dakshineswar. Balarām took
him into the inner apartments and served him with refreshments. The
ladies of the family saluted the Master.</p>
<p>The devotees were singing kirtan in the drawing-room, awaiting the
Master\'s coming. Presently Sri Ramakrishna came and joined the singers.</p>
<p>The kirtan went on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Behold, my Gora is dancing! With the devotees</em></p>
<p><em>He dances in Srivas\'s courtyard, singing the kirtan.</em></p>
<p><em>Gora says to all, \"Repeat the name of Hari!\"</em></p>
<p><em>He looks at Gadadhar, and from his red eyes</em></p>
<p><em>Are flowing tears of love over his golden body.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Master improvised the lines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Gora is dancing in the kirtan:</em></p>
<p><em>There he dances, Sachi\'s darling!</em></p>
<p><em>There he dances, my Gaurānga!</em></p>
<p><em>There he dances, my soul\'s beloved!</em></p>
