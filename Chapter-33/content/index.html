<p>VISIT TO THE SINTHI BRAMO SAMAJ</p>
<blockquote>
<p>October 19, 1884</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ON THIS DAY Sri Ramakrishna again visited the Sinthi Brahmo Samaj. It
was the occasion of the autumn</p>
<p>festival of the Samaj, which was being celebrated at Benimadhav Pal\'s
garden house. The hall was decorated</p>
<p>with flowers and greens, flags and festoons, of various colours.
Outside, the blue autumn sky with its fleecy</p>
<p>clouds was reflected in the water of the lake.</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna arrived at half past four in the afternoon. Entering the
hall, he bowed down before the altar. The Brahmo devotees, among whom
could be noticed Vijay and Trailokya, sat around him. A sub-judge, who
was a member of the Brahmo Samaj, was with them.</p>
<p>Trailokya was entertaining the devotees with his melodious music.</p>
<p>MASTER (to Trailokya): \"That song of yours, \'O Mother, make me mad
with Thy love\', I enjoy very much. Won\'t you sing it?\"</p>
<p>Trailokya sang:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>O Mother, make me mad with Thy love!</em></p>
<p><em>What need have I of knowledge or reason?</em></p>
<p><em>Make me drunk with Thy love\'s Wine;</em></p>
<p><em>O Thou who stealest Thy bhaktas\' hearts,</em></p>
<p><em>Drown me deep in the Sea of Thy love!</em></p>
<p><em>Here in this world, this madhouse of Thine,</em></p>
<p><em>Some laugh, some weep, some dance for joy:</em></p>
<p><em>Jesus, Buddha, Moses, Gaurānga,</em></p>
<p><em>All are drunk with the Wine of Thy love.</em></p>
<p><em>O Mother, when shall I be blessed</em></p>
<p><em>By joining their blissful company?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As he listened to the song, the Master\'s mind underwent a
transformation, and presently he went into deep samādhi. Coming down a
little to the plane of the sense world, he gave instruction to the
devotees. His mind was still charged with the divine experience. His
words were spoken as if in a state of intoxication. Gradually he became
again fully conscious of the world.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"O Mother! I don\'t want the bliss of divine inebriation. I
shall eat siddhi.</p>
<p><strong>Occult powers</strong></p>
<p>(To the devotees) \"By \'siddhi\' I mean the attainment of the spiritual
goal and not one of the eight occult powers. About the occult powers,
Sri Krishna said to Arjuna, \'Friend, if you find anyone who has
acquired even one of the eight powers, then know for certain he will not
realize Me.\' For powers surely beget pride, and God cannot be realized
if there is the slightest trace of pride.</p>
<p><strong>Four classes of devotees</strong></p>
<p>\"According to a certain school of thought there are four classes of
devotees: the pravartaka, the sadhaka, the siddha, and the siddha of the
siddha. He who has just begun religious life is a pravartaka. Such a man
puts his denominational marks on his body and forehead, wears a rosary
around his neck, and scrupulously follows other outer conventions. The
sadhaka has advanced farther. His desire for outer show has become less.
He longs for the realization of God and prays to Him sincerely. He
repeats the name of God and calls on Him with a guileless heart. Now,
whom should we call the siddha? He who has the absolute conviction that
Cod exists and is the sole Doer; he who has seen God. And who is the
siddha of the siddha? He who has not merely seen</p>
<p>God, but has intimately talked with Him as Father, Son, or Beloved.</p>
<p><strong>Difference between intellectual understanding and actual vision</strong></p>
<p>\"It is one thing to believe beyond a doubt that fire exists in wood,
but it is quite another to get the fire from the wood, cook rice with
its help, appease one\'s hunger, and so be satisfied. These are two
entirely different things.</p>
<p>\"No one can put a limit to spiritual experience. If you refer to one
experience, there is another beyond that, and still another, and so on.</p>
<p><strong>Advice to Brahmo</strong></p>
<p>(In an ecstatic mood, referring to the Brahmos) \'They are Brahma
jnanis. They believe in the formless Deity.</p>
<p>That is good.</p>
<p>(To the Brahmo devotees) \"Be firm in one ideal-either in God with form
or in the formless God. Then alone will you realize God; otherwise not.
With firm and unwavering belief the followers of God with form will
realize Him, as will those who speak of Him as formless. You may eat a
cake with icing either straight or sidewise; it will taste sweet either
way. (All laugh.)</p>
<p><strong>Need of firmness and conviction</strong></p>
<p>\"But you must have firm conviction, you must pray to Him
whole-heartedly.</p>
<p><strong>Faith of the worldly-minded</strong></p>
<p>Do you know what the God of worldly people is like? It is like
children\'s saying to one another while at play, \'I swear by God.\'
They have learnt the word from the quarrels of their aunts or
grandmothers. Or it is like God to a dandy. The dandy, all spick and
span, his lips red from chewing betel-leaf, walks in the garden, cane in
hand, and, plucking a flower, exclaims to his friend, \'Ah! What a
beautiful flower God has made!\' But this feeling of a worldly person is
momentary. It lasts as long as a drop of water on a red-hot frying-pan.</p>
<p>\"You must be firm in one ideal. Dive deep. Otherwise you cannot get the
gems at the bottom of the ocean. You cannot pick up the gems if you only
float on the surface.\"</p>
<p>With these words the Master sang in the sweet voice that had bewitched
the hearts of devotees like Keshab:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Dive deep, O mind, dive deep in the Ocean of God\'s Beauty;</em></p>
<p><em>If you descend to the uttermost depths,</em></p>
<p><em>There you will find the gem of Love. . . .</em></p>
<p><em>The devotees felt as if they were in paradise itself.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Seek the Creator and not the world\'s beauty</strong></p>
<p>MASTER (to the Brahmos): \"Dive deep. Learn to love God. Plunge into
divine love. You see, I have heard how you pray. Why do you Brahmos
dwell so much on the glories of God? Is there such great need of your
saying over and over again, \'O God, You have created the sky, the great
oceans, the lunar world, the solar world, and the stellar world\'?</p>
<p>\"Everybody is wonder-struck at the mere sight of a rich man\'s garden
house. People become speechless at the sight of the trees, the flowers,
the ponds, the drawing-room, the pictures. But alas, how few are they
who seek the owner of all these! Only one or two inquire after him. He
who seeks God with a longing heart can see Him, talk to Him as I am
talking to you. Believe my words when I say that God can be seen. But
ah! To whom am I saying these words? Who will believe me?</p>
<p><strong>Futility of mere study</strong></p>
<p>\"Can one find God in the sacred books? By reading the scriptures one
may feel at the most that God exists.</p>
<p>But God does not reveal Himself to a man unless he himself dives deep.
Only after such a plunge, after the revelation of God through His grace,
is one\'s doubt destroyed. You. may read scriptures by the thousands and
recite thousands of texts; but unless you plunge into God with yearning
of heart, you will not comprehend Him. By mere scholarship you may fool
man, but not God.</p>
<p>\"Scriptures and books-what can one achieve with these alone? Nothing
can be realized without His grace. Strive with a longing heart for His
grace. Through His grace you will see Him and He will talk to you.\"</p>
<p><strong>Different degrees of divine manifestation</strong></p>
<p>SUB-JUDGE: \"Sir, does God show more grace to one than to another? If
so, He can be accused of the fault of partiality.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"What are you saying? Do you mean to say that the moon and a
glow-worm are the same, though both give light? Iswar Vidyāsāgar asked
me the same question. He said, \'Is it a fact, sir, that God gives more
power to one and less to another?\' \'God\', I said, \'exists in every
being as the All pervading Spirit. He is in the ant as well as in me.
But there are different manifestations of His Power in different beings.
If all are the same, then why have we come here to see you, attracted by
your renown? Have you grown a pair of horns? Oh, no! It is not that. You
have compassion; you have scholarship; there is a greater degree of
these virtues in you than in others. That is the reason you are so well
known.\' Don\'t you see that there are men who, single-handed, can
defeat a hundred persons? Again, one man takes to his heels in fear of
another; you see such a person, too. If there are not different
manifestations of power in different beings, then why did people respect
Keshab Sen so much?</p>
<p>\"It is said in the Gitā that if a man is respected and honoured by
many, whether it be for his scholarship or his music or his oratory or
anything else, then you may know for certain that he is endowed with a
special divine power.\"</p>
<p>A BRAMO (to the sub-judge): \"Why don\'t you accept what he says?\"</p>
<p>MASTER (sharply, to the Brahmo): \"What sort of man are you? To accept
words without conviction! Why, that is hypocrisy! I see you are only a
counterfeit.\"</p>
<p>The Brahmo was much embarrassed.</p>
<p><strong>Advice to the worldly-minded &amp; Prayer in solitude</strong></p>
<p>SUB-JUDGE: \"Sir, must we renounce the world?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"No. Why should you? A man can realize God even in the world.
But at the beginning he must spend a few days in solitude. He must
practise spiritual discipline in a solitary place. He should take a room
near his house, so that he may come home only for his meals. Keshab,
Pratap, and others said to me, \'Sir, we follow the ideal of King
Janaka.\' \'Mere words don\'t make a King Janaka\', I replied. \'How
many austerities King Janaka first had to perform in solitude-standing
on his head, and so on! Do something first; then you may become a King
Janaka.\' You see a man writing English fluently; but could he do that
at the very start? Perhaps he was the son of poor parents; he was cook
in a family and earned his meals by his service. Perhaps he had to
struggle hard to go on with his studies. It is after all these efforts
that he can now write such fluent English.</p>
<p><strong>Danger of \"woman and gold\"</strong></p>
<p>\"I said to Keshab Sen further, \'How can the worldly man be cured of
his serious disease unless he goes into solitude?\' A worldly man is
suffering from delirious fever, as it were. Suppose there are pickled
tamarind and jars of water in the room of such a patient. Now, how can
you expect him to get rid of the disease? Just see, the very mention of
pickled tamarind is making my mouth water! (All laugh.) You can very
well imagine what will happen if the tamarind is actually put in front
of me. To a man, a woman is the pickled tamarind, and his desire for
enjoyment, the jars of water. There is neither end nor limit to this
desire for worldly enjoyment. And the things are in the patient\'s very
room. Can you expect the patient to get rid of the delirious fever in
this</p>
<p>fashion? He must be removed for a few days to another place where there
are neither pickled tamarind nor water-jars. Then he will be cured.
After that if he returns to his old room he will have nothing to fear.
\'Woman and gold\' cannot do any harm to the man who lives in the world
after attaining God. Only then can he lead a detached life in the world
as King Janaka did. But he must be careful at the beginning. He must
practise spiritual discipline in strict solitude. The peepal-tree, when
young, is fenced around to protect it from cattle. But there is no need
for the fence when the trunk grows thick and strong. Then no harm will
be done to the tree even if an elephant is tied to it. \'Woman and
gold\' will not be able to harm you in the least, if you go home and
lead a householder\'s life after increasing your spiritual strength and
developing love for the Lotus Feet of God through the practice of
spiritual discipline in solitude.</p>
<p>\"A man sets milk in a quiet place to curdle, and then he extracts
butter from the curd. After once extracting the butter of Devotion and
Knowledge from the milk of the mind, if you keep that transformed mind
in the water of the world, it will float in the world unattached. But if
the mind in its \'unripe\' state-that is to say, when it is just like
liquid milk-is kept in the water of the world, then the milk and water
will get mixed. In that case it will be impossible for the mind to float
unattached in the world.</p>
<p>\"Live in the world but, in order to realize God, hold fast to His Lotus
Feet with one hand and with the other do your duties. When you get a
respite from your duties, cling to God\'s Lotus Feet with both
hands-live in solitude and meditate on Him and serve Him ceaselessly.\"</p>
<p>SUB-JUDGE (joyously): \"Sir, these are very beautiful words indeed. Of
course one must practise spiritual discipline in solitude. But we forget
all about it. We think we have become King Janaka outright! (The Master
and the devotees laugh.) I feel very happy and peaceful even to hear
that there is no need to give up the world and that God can be realized
from home as well.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Why should you give up the world? Since you must fight, it is
wise for you to fight from a fort. You must fight against your
sense-organs, against your hunger and thirst. Therefore you will be wise
to face the battle from the world. Further, in the Kaliyuga the life of
a man depends on his food. If one day you have nothing to eat, then you
will forget all about God. A man once said to his wife, \'I am going to
leave the world.\' She was a sensible woman. She said: \'Why should you
wander about? If you don\'t have to knock at ten doors for your
stomach\'s sake, go. But if that is the case, then better live in this
one place.\'</p>
<p>\"Again I say, why should you give up the world? You will find it more
convenient at home. You won\'t have to worry about food. You may even
live with your wife. It isn\'t harmful. You will find near at hand all
that the body needs at different times. When you are ill, you will have
someone near you to nurse you.</p>
<p>\"Sages like Janaka, Vyāsa, and Vasishtha lived in the world after
attaining Knowledge. They fenced with two swords, the one of Knowledge
and the other of action.\"</p>
<p>SUB-JUDGE: \"How can we know that we have Knowledge?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"When one has Knowledge one does not see God any more at a
distance. One does not think of Him any more as \'He\'. He becomes
\'This\'. Then He is seen in one\'s own heart. God dwells in every man.
He who seeks God realizes Him.\"</p>
<p><strong>Sin and God\'s name</strong></p>
<p>SUB-JUDGE: \"Sir, I am a sinner. How can I say that God dwells in me?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"That\'s the one trouble with you Brahmos. With you it is
always sin and sin! That\'s the Christian view, isn\'t it? Once a man
gave me a Bible.A part of it was read to me, and it was full of that one
thing-sin and sin! One must have such faith that one can say: \'I have
uttered the name of God; I have repeated the name of Rāma or Hari. How
can I be a sinner?\' One must have faith in the glory of God\'s name.\"</p>
<p>SUB-JUDGE: \"Sir, how can one have such faith?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Have passionate love for God. One of your Brahmo songs says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>O Lord, is it ever possible to know Thee without love,</em></p>
<p><em>However much one may perform worship and sacrifice?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pray to God in secret and with yearning, that you may have that
passionate attachment and devotion to Him. Shed tears for Him. A man
sheds a jugful of tears because his wife is sick or because he is losing
money or because he is worrying about getting a job. But tell me, who
ever weeps for God?\'</p>
<p><strong>Self-surrender to God</strong></p>
<p>TRAlLOKYA: \"Sir, where is people\'s leisure? They must serve their
English masters.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Well, then give God the power of attorney. If a man entrusts
his affairs to a good person, will the latter do him any harm? With all
the sincerity of your heart resign yourself to God and drive all your
worries out of your mind. Do whatever duties He has assigned to you. The
kitten does not have a calculating mind. It only cries, \'Mew, mew!\' It
lies in the kitchen contentedly if the mother cat leaves it there, and
only calls the mother, crying, \'Mew, mew!\' It has the same feeling of
contentment when the mother cat puts it on the soft bed of the master of
the house. It only cries for its mother.\"</p>
<p><strong>Duty to wife and children</strong></p>
<p>SUB-JUDGE: \"Sir, we are householders. How long should we perform our
worldly duties?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Surely you have duties to perform. You must bring up your
children, support your wife, and provide for her in case of your death.
If you don\'t, then I shall call you unkind. Sages like Sukadeva had
compassion. He who has no compassion is no man.\"</p>
<p>SUB-JUDGE: \"How long should one support one\'s children?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"As long as they have not reached their majority. When the
chick becomes a full-grown bird and can look after itself, then the
mother bird pecks it and doesn\'t allow it to come near her.\" (All
laugh.)</p>
<p>SUB-JUDGE: \"What is a householder\'s duty to his wife?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"You should give her spiritual advice and support her during
your lifetime and provide for her livelihood after your death, if she is
a chaste wife.</p>
<p>\"But if you are intoxicated with the Knowledge of God, then you have no
more duties to perform. Then God Himself will think about your morrow if
you yourself cannot do so. God Himself will think about your family if
you are intoxicated with Him. If a landlord dies leaving behind a minor
son, then a guardian appointed by the court takes charge of the son.
These are all points of law; you know them.\"</p>
<p>SUB-JUDGE: \"Yes, sir.\"</p>
<p>VIJAY: \"Ah! Priceless words! God Himself carries on His shoulders all
the responsibilities of a person who thinks of Him with single-minded
devotion and is mad with divine love. A minor gets his guardian without
seeking him. Alas, when shall I have that state of mind? How lucky they
are who feel that way!\"</p>
<p>TRAILOKYA: \"Is it ever possible, sir, to have true knowledge of God
while living in the world? Can one realize God here?\"</p>
<p>MASTER (with a smile): \"Why do you worry? You are enjoying both treacle
and refined sugar. (All laugh.) You are living in the world with your
mind in God. Isn\'t that true? Why shouldn\'t a man realize God in the
world\'? Certainly he can.\"</p>
<p>TRAILOKYA: What are the signs of a householder having attained
Knowledge?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"His tears will flow, and the hair on his body will stand on
end. No sooner does he hear the sweet name of God than the hair on his
body stands on end from sheer delight, and tears roll down his cheeks.
\"A man cannot get rid of body-consciousness as long as he is attached
to worldly things and loves \'woman and gold\'. As he becomes less and
less attached to worldly things, he approaches nearer and nearer to the
Knowledge of Self. He also becomes less and less conscious of his body.
He attains Self-Knowledge when his worldly attachment totally
disappears. Then he realizes that body and soul are two separate things.
It is very difficult to separate with a knife the kernel of a coconut
from the shell before the milk inside has dried up. When the milk dries
up, the kernel rattles inside the shell. At that time it loosens itself
from the shell. Then the fruit is called a dry coconut.</p>
<p><strong>Signs of God-vision</strong></p>
<p>\"The sign of a man\'s having realized God is that he has become like a
dry coconut. He has become utterly free from the consciousness that he
is the body. He does not feel happy or unhappy with the happiness or
unhappiness of the body. He does not seek the comforts of the body. He
roams about in the world as a jivanmukta, one liberated in life. \'The
devotee of Kāli is a jivanmukta , full of Eternal Bliss.\'</p>
<p>\"When you find that the very mention of God\'s name brings tears to
your eyes and makes your hair stand on end, then you will know that you
have freed yourself from attachment to \'woman and gold\' and attained
God. If the matches are dry, you get a spark by striking only one of
them. But if they are damp, you don\'t get a spark even if you strike
fifty. You only waste matches. Similarly, if your mind is soaked in the
pleasure of worldly things, in \'woman and gold\', then
God-Consciousness will not be kindled in you. You may try a thousand
times, but all your efforts will be futile. But no sooner does
attachment to worldly pleasure dry up than the spark of God flashes
forth.\"</p>
<p><strong>Force your demand on the Divine Mother</strong></p>
<p>TRAILOKYA: \"What is the way to dry up the craving for worldly
pleasure?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Pray to the Divine Mother with a longing heart. Her vision
dries up all craving for the world and completely destroys all
attachment to \'woman and gold\'. It happens instantly if you think of
Her as your own mother. She is by no means a godmother. She is your own
mother. With a yearning heart persist in your demands on Her. The child
holds to the skirt of its mother and begs a penny of her to buy a kite.
Perhaps the mother is gossiping with her friends. At first she refuses
to give the penny and says to the child: \'No, you can\'t have it. Your
daddy has asked me not to give you money. When he comes home I\'ll ask
him about it. You will get into trouble if you play with a kite now.\'
The child begins to cry and will not give up his demand. Then the mother
says to her friends: \'Excuse me a moment. Let me pacify this child.\'
Immediately she unlocks the cash-box with a click and throws the child a
penny.</p>
<p>\"You too must force your demand on the Divine Mother. She will come to
you without fail. I once said the same thing to some Sikhs when they
visited the temple at Dakshineswar. We were conversing in front of the
Kāli temple. They said, \'God is compassionate.\' \'Why compassionate?\'
I asked. They said, \'Why, revered sir, He constantly looks after us,
gives us righteousness and wealth, and provides us with our food.\'
\'Suppose\', I said, \'a man has children. Who will look after them and
provide them with food-their own father, or a man from another
village?\'</p>
<p>SUB-JUDGE: \"Is not God, then, compassionate, sir?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Why should you think that? I just made a remark. What I mean
to say is that God is our very own. We can exert force on Him. With
one\'s own people one can even go so far as to say, \'You rascal! Won\'t
you give it to me?\'</p>
<p><strong>Futility of egotism</strong></p>
<p>(To the sub-judge) \"Let me ask you one thing. Are vanity and egotism
the result of knowledge or of</p>
<p>ignorance? Egotism is of the nature of tamas; it is begotten by
ignorance. On account of the barrier of ego one does not see God. \'All
troubles come to an end when the ego dies.\' It is futile to be
egotistic. Neither body nor wealth will last. Once a drunkard was
looking at the image of Durga. At the sight of Her decorations, he said,
\'Well, Mother! However You may fix Yourself up, after two or three days
they will drag You out and throw You into the Ganges.\' (All laugh.)</p>
<p>\"So I say to you all, you may be a judge or anybody else, but it is all
for two days only. Therefore you should give up vanity and pride.</p>
<p><strong>Sattva, rajas, and tamas</strong></p>
<p>\"The characteristics of sattva, rajas, and tamas are very different.
Egotism sleep, gluttony, lust, anger, and the like, are the traits of\'
people with tamas. Men with rajas entangle themselves in many
activities. Such a man has clothes all spick and span. His house is
immaculately clean. A portrait of the Queen hangs on a wall in his
drawing-room. When he worships God he wears a silk cloth. He has a
string of rudraksha beads around his neck, and in between the beads he
puts a few gold ones. When someone comes to visit the worship hall in
his house, he himself acts as guide. After showing the hall, he says to
the visitor: \'Please come this way, sir. There are other things too-the
floor of white marble and the natmandir with its exquisite carvings.\'
When he gives in charity he makes a show of it. But a man endowed with
sattva is quiet and peaceful. So far as dress is concerned, anything
will do. He earns only enough money to give his stomach the simplest of
food; he never flatters men to get money. His house is out of repair. He
never worries about his children\'s clothing. He does not hanker for
name and fame. His worship, charity, and meditation are all done in
secret; people do not know, about them at all. He meditates inside his
mosquito curtain. People think he doesn\'t sleep well at night and for
that reason sleeps late in the morning. Sattva is the last step of the
stairs; next is the roof. As soon as sattva is acquired there is no
further delay in attaining God. One step forward and God is realized.
(To the sub-judge) Didn\'t you say that all men were equal? Now you see
that there are so many varieties of human nature.</p>
<p><strong>Four classes of men</strong></p>
<p>\"There are still other classes and kinds of people. For instance, there
are those who are eternally free, those who have attained liberation,
those struggling for liberation, and those entangled in the world. So
many varieties of men! Sages like Nārada and Sukadeva are eternally
free. They are like a steamship, which not only crosses the ocean but
can carry big animals, even an elephant. Further, the soul that is
eternally free is like the superintendent of an estate. After bringing
one part of the estate under control, he goes to another. Those
struggling for liberation strive heart and soul to free themselves from
the net of the world. One or two of them may get out of the net. They
are called the liberated. The souls that are eternally free are like
clever fish; they are never caught in the net.</p>
<p>\"But the souls that are entangled, involved in worldliness, never come
to their senses. They lie in the net but are not even conscious that
they are entangled. If you speak of God before them, they at once leave
the place. They say: \'Why God now? We shall think of Him in the hour of
death.\' But when they lie on their death-beds, they say to their wives
or children: \'Why have you put so many wicks in the lamp? Use only one
wick. Otherwise too much oil will be burnt.\' While dying they think of
their wives and children, and weep, \'Alas! What will happen to them
after my death?\'</p>
<p><strong>The entangled soul</strong></p>
<p>\"The entangled souls repeat those very actions that make them suffer so
much. They are like the camel, which eats thorny bushes till the blood
streams from its mouth, but still will not give them up. Such a man may
have lost his son and be stricken with grief, but still he will have
children year after year. He may ruin himself by his daughter\'s
marriage, but still he will go on having daughters every year. And he
says: \'What can I do? It\'s just my luck!\' When he goes to a holy
place he doesn\'t have any time to think of God. He almost kills himself
carrying bundles for his wife. Entering the temple, he is very eager to
give his child the holy water to drink or make him roll on the floor;
but he has no time for his own devotions. These bound creatures slave
for their</p>
<p>masters to earn food for themselves and their families; and they earn
money by lying, cheating, flattery. They laugh at those who think of God
and meditate on Him, and call them lunatics.</p>
<p>\"So you see how many different kinds of men there are. You said that
all men were equal. But how many varieties of men there are! Some have
more power and some less.</p>
<p><strong>Thought of God at the hour of death</strong></p>
<p>\"The entangled creatures, attached to worldliness, talk only of worldly
things in the hour of death. What will it avail such men if they
outwardly repeat the name of God, take a bath in the Ganges, or visit
sacred places? If they cherish within themselves attachment to the
world, it must show up at the hour of death. While dying they rave
nonsense. Perhaps they cry out in a delirium, \'Turmeric powder!
Seasoning! Bay-leaf!\' The singing parrot, when at ease, repeats the
holy names of Radha and Krishna, but when it is seized by a cat it
utters its own natural sound; it squawks, \'Kaa! Kaa!\' It is said in
the Gitā that whatever one thinks in the hour of death, one becomes in
the after-life. King Bharata gave up his body exclaiming, \'Deer!
Deer!\' and was born as a deer in his next life. But if a man dies
thinking of God, then he attains God, and he does not have to come back
to the life of this world.\"</p>
<p>A BRAMO DEVOTEE: \"Sir, suppose a man has thought of God at other times
during his life, but at the time of his death forgets Him. Would he, on
that account, come back to this world of sorrow and suffering? Why
should it be so? He certainly thought of God some time during his
life.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"A man thinks of God, no doubt, but he has no faith in Him.
Again and again he forgets God and becomes attached to the world. It is
like giving the elephant a bath; afterwards he covers his body with mud
and dirt again. \'The mind is a mad elephant.\' But if you can make the
elephant go into the stable immediately after bathing him, then he stays
clean. Just so, if a man thinks of God in the hour of death, then his
mind becomes pure and it gets no more opportunity to become attached to
\'woman and gold\'.</p>
<p>\"Man has no faith in God. That is the reason he suffers so much. They
say that when you plunge into the holy waters of the Ganges your sins
perch on a tree on the bank. No sooner do you come out of the water
after the bath than the sins jump back on your shoulders. (All laugh.) A
man must prepare the way beforehand, so that he may think of God in the
hour of death. The way lies through constant practice. If a man
practises meditation on God, he will remember God even on the last day
of his life.\"</p>
<p>A BRAHMO DEVOTEE: \"You have spoken very beautifully, sir. Beautiful
words, indeed.\"</p>
<p><strong>Master\'s humility</strong></p>
<p>MASTER: \"Oh, this is just idle talk. But do you know my inner feeling?
I am the machine and God is the Operator. I am the house and He is the
Indweller. I am the engine and He is the Engineer. I am the chariot and
He is the Charioteer. I move as He moves me; I do as He makes me do.\"</p>
<p>Presently Trailokya began to sing to the accompaniment of drums and
cymbals. Sri Ramakrishna danced, intoxicated with divine love. Many
times he went into samādhi. He stood still, his eyes fixed, his face
beaming, with one hand on the shoulder of a beloved disciple. Coming
down a little from the state of ecstasy, he danced again like a mad
elephant. Regaining consciousness of the outer world, he improvised
lines to the music:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>O Mother, dance about Thy devotees!</em></p>
<p><em>Dance Thyself and make them dance as well.</em></p>
<p><em>O Mother, dance in the lotus of my heart;</em></p>
<p><em>Dance, O Thou the ever blessed Brahman!</em></p>
<p><em>Dance in all Thy world-bewitching beauty.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>An indescribable scene. The exquisite and celestial dance of a child
completely filled with ecstatic love of God and identified heart and
soul with the Divine Mother! The Brahmo devotees danced around the
Master again and again, attracted like iron to a magnet. In ecstatic
voices they chanted the name of Brahman. Again, they</p>
<p>chanted the name of the Divine Mother. Many of them wept like children,
crying, \"Mother! Mother!\"</p>
<p>When the music was over, the devotees and the Master sat down. Although
it was about eight o\'clock, the evening worship of the Brahmo Samaj had
not yet begun. In the joy of this divine music they had forgotten all
about their formal worship. Vijay, who was to conduct the evening
service, sat facing the Master. His mother-in-law and the other Brahmo
ladies wanted to see Sri Ramakrishna; so the Master went to meet them in
another room.</p>
<p>After a time the Master came back and said to Vijay: \"What devotion to
God your mother-in-law has! About</p>
<p>the worldly life she said to me: \'Oh, you needn\'t tell me about the
world. No sooner does one wave disappear</p>
<p>than another rises up.\' \'But\', I said, \'what is that to you? You
have knowledge.\' She replied: \'Where is my knowledge? I haven\'t yet
been able to go beyond Vidyā-māyā and Avidyā-māyā. It won\'t help me
much to go beyond just the illusion of ignorance; I shall have to
transcend the illusion of knowledge as well. Only then shall I have true
knowledge of God. I am quoting your own words.\' \"</p>
<p>While they were talking, Beni Pāl, their host, entered the room.</p>
<p>BENI (to Vijay): \"Sir, please get up. It is already late. Please begin
the worship.\"</p>
<p>VIJAY; \"What further need is there of worship? I find that according to
your arrangement the rice pudding is served first, and then the soup and
other dishes.\"</p>
<p>MASTER (with a smile): \'The devotees provide offerings according to
their temperaments. The sattvic devotee offers the Deity simple rice
pudding, and the rajasic devotee, fifty different dishes. The tamasic
devotee slaughters goats and other animals.\"</p>
<p>Vijay began to hesitate about going to the platform to conduct the
worship. He said to the Master, \"I shall conduct the worship from the
platform only if you give me your blessing.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"It will be all right if you don\'t feel any egotism, if you
don\'t have the vain feeling: \'I am giving a lecture. Listen to me.\'
What begets egotism? Knowledge or ignorance? It is only the humble man
who attains Knowledge. In a low place rain-water collects. It runs down
from a mound.</p>
<p>\"A man achieves neither Knowledge nor liberation as long as he has
egotism. He comes back again and again to the world. The calf bellows,
\'Hamba! Hamba!\', that is, \'I! I!\' That is why it suffers such agony.
The butcher slaughters it and the shoe-maker makes shoes from its hide.
Besides, its hide is used for the drum, which is beaten mercilessly.
Still no end to its misery! At long last a carding machine is made from
its entrails. While carding the cotton the machine makes the sound
\'Tuhu! Tuhu!\', that is, \'Thou! Thou!\' Then the poor calf is released
from all suffering. It no longer says, \'Hamba! Hamba!\' but repeats,
\'Tuhu! Tuhu!\' The calf says, as it were, \'O God, Thou art the Doer
and I am nothing. Thou art the Operator and I am the machine. Thou art
everything.\'</p>
<p>\"Three words-\'master\', \'teacher\', and \'father\'-prick me like
thorns. I am the son of God, His eternal child. How can I be a
\'father\'? God alone is the Master and I am His instrument. He is the
Operator and I am the machine.</p>
<p>\"If somebody addresses me as guru, I say to him: \'Go away, you fool!
How can I be a teacher?\' There is no teacher except Satchidananda.
There is no refuge except Him. He alone is the Ferryman to take one
across the ocean of the world. (To Vijay) It is very difficult to act as
an Āchārya. It harms the Āchārya himself. Finding a number of men doing
him reverence, he sits you put four seers of milk in a one-seer jar? If
God, through His grace, ever reveals Himself to His devotee and makes
him understand, then he will know; but not otherwise.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>\"That which is Brahman is Śakti, and That, again, is the Mother.</em></p>
<p><em>He it is, says Ramprasad, that I approach as Mother;</em></p>
<p><em>But must I give away the secret, here in the market-place? From the
hints I have given, 0 mind, guess what that Being is!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ramprasad implies that he has known the truth of Brahman. He addresses
Brahman as Mother.</p>
<p>\"In another song Ramprasad expresses the same idea thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Knowing the secret that K āli is one with the highest Brahman, I have
discarded, once for all, both dharma and adharma.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Adharma means unrighteous actions, actions forbidden by religion. Dharma
means the pious actions prescribed by religion, as, for instance,
charity to the poor, feeding the brahmins, and so on.\"</p>
<p>VIJAY: \"What remains if one renounces both dharma and dharma?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Pure love of God. I prayed to the Divine Mother: \'O Mother;
here, take Thy dharma; here, take Thy adharma; and give me pure love for
Thee. Here, take Thy virtue; here, take Thy vice; and give me pure love
for Thee. Here, take Thy knowledge; here, take Thy ignorance; and give
me pure love for Thee.\' You see, I didn\'t ask even for knowledge or
public recognition. When one renounces both dharma and adharma, there
remains only pure love of God-love that is stainless, motiveless, and
that one feels only for the sake of love.\"</p>
<p>A BRAMO DEVOTEE: \"Is God different from His Śakti?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"After attaining Perfect Knowledge one realizes that they are
not different. They are the same, like the gem and its brilliance.
Thinking of the gem, one cannot but think of its brilliance. Again, they
are like milk and its whiteness. Thinking of the one, you must also
think of the other. But you cannot realize this non-duality before the
attainment of Perfect Knowledge. Attaining Perfect Knowledge, one goes
into samādhi, beyond the twenty-four cosmic principles. Therefore the
principle of \'I\' does not exist in that stage. A man cannot describe
in words what he feels in samādhi.Coming down, he can give just a hint
about it. I come down a hundred cubits, as it were, when I say \'Om\'
after samādhi. Brahman is beyond the injunctions of the Vedas and cannot
be described. There neither \'I\' nor \'you\' exists.</p>
<p>\"As long as a man is conscious of \'I\' and \'you\', and as long as he
feels that it is he who prays or meditates, so long will he feel that
God is listening to his prayer and that God is a Person. Then he must
say: \'O God, Thou art the Master and I am Thy servant. Thou art the
whole and I am a part of Thee. Thou art the Mother and I am Thy child.\'
At that time there exists a feeling of difference: \'I am one and Thou
art another.\' It is God Himself who makes us feel this difference; and
on account of this difference one sees man and woman, light and
darkness, and so on. As long as one is aware of this difference, one
must accept Śakti, the Personal God. It is God who has put
\'I-consciousness\' in us. You may reason a thousand times; still this
\'I\' does not disappear. As long as \'I-consciousness\' exists, God
reveals Himself to us as a Person.</p>
<p>\"Therefore, as long as a man is conscious of \'I\' and of
differentiation, he cannot speak of the attributeless Brahman and must
accept Brahman with attributes. This Brahman with attributes has been
declared in the Vedas, the Puranas, and the Tantra, to be Kāli, the
Primal Energy.\"</p>
<p><strong>Way to Brahmajnana</strong></p>
<p>VIJAY: \"How, sir, can one have the vision of the Primal Energy and
attain Brahmajnana, the Knowledge of the attributeless Brahman?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Pray to Him with a yearning heart, and weep. That will purify
your heart. You see the reflection of the sun in clear water. In the
mirror of his \'I-consciousness\' the devotee sees the form of the
Primal Energy, Brahman with attributes. But the mirror must be wiped
clean. One does not see the right reflection if there is any dirt on the
mirror.</p>
<p>\"As long as a man must see the Sun in the water of his
\'I-consciousness\' and has no other means of seeing It,</p>
<p>as long as he has no means of seeing the real Sun except through Its
reflection, so long is the reflected sun alone one hundred per cent real
to him. As long as the \'I\' is real, so long is the reflected sun
real-one hundred per cent real. That reflected sun is nothing but the
Primal Energy.</p>
<p>\"But if you seek Brahmajnana, the Knowledge of the attributeless
Brahman, then proceed to the real Sun through Its reflection. Pray to
Brahman with attributes, who listens to your prayers, and He Himself
will give you full Knowledge of Brahman; for that which is Brahman with
attributes is verily Brahman without attributes, that which is Brahman
is verily Śakti. One realizes this non-duality after the attainment of
Perfect Knowledge.</p>
<p>\"The Divine Mother gives Her devotee Brahmajnana too. But a true lover
of God generally does not seek the Knowledge of Brahman.</p>
<p>\"There is another path, the path of knowledge, which is very difficult.
You members of the Brahmo Samaj are not jnanis. You are bhaktas. The
Jnāni believes that Brahman alone is real and the world illusory as a
dream. To him, \'I\' and \'you\' are illusory as a dream.</p>
<p>\"God is our Inner Controller. Pray to Him with a pure and guileless
heart. He will explain everything to you. Give up egotism and take
refuge in Him. You will realize everything.\"</p>
<p>The Master sang:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Dwell, O mind, within yourself;</em></p>
<p><em>Enter no other\'s home.</em></p>
<p><em>If you but seek there, you will find</em></p>
<p><em>All you are searching for.</em></p>
<p><em>God, the true Philosopher\'s Stone,</em></p>
<p><em>Who answers every prayer,</em></p>
<p><em>Lies hidden deep within your heart,</em></p>
<p><em>The richest gem of all.</em></p>
<p><em>How many pearls and precious stones</em></p>
<p><em>Are scattered all about</em></p>
<p><em>The outer court that lies before</em></p>
<p><em>The chamber of your heart!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He continued: \"When you mix with people outside your Samaj, love them
all. When in their company be one of them. Don\'t harbour malice toward
them. Don\'t turn up your nose in hatred and say: \'Oh, this man
believes in God with form and not in the formless God. That man believes
in the formless God and not in God with form. This man is a Christian.
This man is a Hindu. And this man is a Musslman.\' It is God alone who
makes people see things in different ways. Know that people have
different natures. Realize this and mix with them as much as you can.
And love all. But enter your own inner chamber to enjoy peace and bliss.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Lighting the lamp of Knowledge in the chamber of your heart, Behold
the face of the Mother, Brahman\'s Embodiment.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can see your true Self only within your own chamber. The cowherds
take the cows to graze in the pasture. There the cattle mix. They all
form one herd. But on returning to their sheds in the evening they are
separated. Then each stays by itself in its own stall. Therefore I say,
dwell by yourself in your own chamber.\"</p>
<p>It was ten o\'clock in the evening. The Master got into a carriage to
return to Dakshineswar. One or two attending devotees got in with him.
The carriage stood under a tree, in deep darkness. Beni Pāl wanted to
send some sweets and other food with Sri Ramakrishna for Ramlal, the
Master\'s nephew.</p>
<p>BENI PĀL: \"Sir, Ramlal was not here this evening. With your permission
I should like to send some sweets for him by your attendants.\"</p>
<p>MASTER (with great anxiety): \"Oh, Beni Pāl! Oh, sir! Please don\'t send
these things with me. That will do me harm. It is never possible for me
to lay up anything. I hope you won\'t mind.\"</p>
<p>BENI PĀL: \"As you please, sir. Please give me your blessing.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Oh, we have been very happy today! You see, he alone is a true
man who has made money his servant. But those who do not know the use of
money are not men even though they have human forms. They may have human
bodies, but they behave like animals. You are blessed indeed. You have
made so many devotees happy today.\"</p>
<p><strong>Monday, October 20, 1884</strong></p>
<p>Two days after the worship of Kāli, the Mārwāris of the Burrabazar
section of Calcutta were celebrating the Annakuta festival. Sri
Ramakrishna had been invited by the Mārwāri devotees to the ceremony at
12 Mallick Street. It was the second day of the bright fortnight of the
moon. The festival connected with the worship of Kāli, known as the
\"Festival of Light\", was still going on at Burra bazar.</p>
<p>About three o\'clock in the afternoon M. and the younger Gopal came to
Burrabazar. M. had in his hand a bundle of cloths he had purchased for
Sri Ramakrishna. Mallick Street was jammed with people, bullock-carts,
and carriages. As M. and Gopal approached Mallick Street they noticed
Sri Ramakrishna in a carriage, which could hardly move because of the
jam. Baburam and Ram Chakravarty were with the Master. He smiled at M.
and Gopal.</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna alighted from the carriage. With Baburam he proceeded on
foot to the house of his host, M. leading the way. They saw the
courtyard of the house filled with big bales of clothes which were being
loaded into bullock-carts for shipment. The Mārwāri host greeted the
Master and led him to the third floor of the house. A painting of Kāli
hung on the wall. Sri Ramakrishna bowed before it. He sat down and
became engaged in conversation with the devotees. One of the Mārwāris
began to stroke his feet. The Master asked him to stop. After reflecting
a minute he said, \"All right, you can stroke them a little.\" His words
were full of compassion.</p>
<p>MASTER (to M.): \"What about your school?\"</p>
<p>M: \"Today is a holiday, sir.\"</p>
<p>MASTER (smiling): \"Tomorrow there will be a musical recital of the
Chandi at Adhar\'s house.\"</p>
<p><strong>Master and the Mārwāri pundit</strong></p>
<p>The host sent a pundit to Sri Ramakrishna. He saluted the Master and
took a seat. Soon they were engaged in conversation. They talked about
spiritual things.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"God incarnates Himself for the bhakta and not for the Jnāni.\"</p>
<p>PUNDIT: \" \'I incarnate Myself in every age for the protection of the
good, for the destruction of the wicked, and for the establishment of
dharma.\' God becomes man, first, for the joy of the bhakta, and
secondly, for the destruction of the wicked. The Jnāni has no desire.\"</p>
<p>MASTER (smiling): \"But I have not got rid of all desires. I have the
desire for love of God.\" The pundit\'s son entered the room. He saluted
the Master and took a seat.</p>
<p>MASTER (to the pundit): \"Well, what is bhava and what is bhakti?\"</p>
<p>PUNDIT: \"Meditation on God mellows the mind. This mellowness is called
bhava. It is like the thawing of ice when the sun rises.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Well, what is prema?\"</p>
<p>The pundit and Sri Ramakrishna were talking in Hindusthani. The former
gave some sort of explanation of prema.</p>
<p>MASTER (to the pundit): \"No! No! That is not the meaning. Prema means
such love for God that it makes a man forget the world and also his
body, which is so dear to him. Chaitanyadeva had prema.\"</p>
<p>PUNDIT: \"Yes, sir. One behaves like a drunkard.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Some people develop bhakti and others do not; how do you
explain that, sir?\"</p>
<p>PUNDIT: \"There is no partiality in God. He is the Wish-fulfilling Tree.
Whatever a man asks of God he gets. But he must go near the Tree to ask
the boon.\"</p>
<p>The pundit said all this in Hindusthani. The Master explained it to M.in
Bengali.</p>
<p><strong>Different kinds of samādhi</strong></p>
<p>MASTER: \"Sir, please describe samādhi to us.\"</p>
<p>PUNDIT: \"There are two kinds of samādhi: savikalpa and nirvikalpa. In
nirvikalpa samādhi the functioning of the mind stops altogether.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Yes. The mind completely takes the form of Reality. The
distinction between the meditator and the object of meditation does not
exist. There are two other kinds of samādhi: chetana and jada. Nārada
and Sukadeva attained chetana samādhi. Isn\'t that true, sir?\"</p>
<p>PUNDIT: \"Yes, sir, that is so.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Further, there are the unmana samādhi and the sthita samādhi.
Isn\'t that true, sir?\"</p>
<p>The pundit remained silent. He did not venture an opinion.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Well, sir, through the practice of japa and austerity one can
get occult powers, such as walking on the water of the Ganges. Isn\'t
that true?\"</p>
<p>PUNDIT: \"Yes, one can. But a devotee doesn\'t want them.\" The
conversation continued for some time. The pundit said he would visit the
Master at Dakshineswar the next ekadasi day.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Ah! Your boy is very nice.\"</p>
<p>PUNDIT: \"Well, revered sir, all this is transitory. It is like the
waves in a river-one goes down and another comes up.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"You have substance in you.\"</p>
<p>After a few minutes the pundit saluted Sri Ramakrishna. He said: \"I
shall have to perform my daily devotions. Please let me go.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Oh, sit down! Sit down!\"</p>
<p>The pundit sat down again. The conversation turned to hathayoga. The
pundit discussed the subject with the Master in Hindusthani. Sri
Ramakrishna said: \"Yes, that is also a form of austerity. But the
hathayogi identifies himself with his body. His mind dwells on his body
alone.\" The pundit took leave of the Master. Sri Ramakrishna conversed
with the pundit\'s son.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"One can understand the Bhagavata well if one has already
studied the Nyaya, the Vedānta , and the</p>
<p>other systems of philosophy. Isn\'t that so?\"</p>
<p>PUNDIT\'S SON: \"Yes, sir. It is very necessary to study the Samkhya
philosophy.\"</p>
<p>The conversation went on. Sri Ramakrishna was leaning against a big
pillow; the devotees were sitting on the floor. Lying in that position,
the Master began to sing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Brother, joyfully cling to God;</em></p>
<p><em>Thus striving, some day you may attain Him.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their host entered the room and saluted Sri Ramakrishna. He was a pious
man and devoted to the Master. The pundit\'s son was still there. The
Master asked if the Panini, the Sanskrit grammar, was taught in the
schools. He further asked about the Nyaya and the Vedānta philosophies.
The host did not show much interest in the discussion and changed the
subject.</p>
<p>HOST: \"Revered sir, what is the way for us?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Chanting the name and glories of God, living in the company of
holy men, and earnestly praying to God.\"</p>
<p>HOST: \"Please bless me, sir, that I may pay less and less attention to
worldly things.\"</p>
<p>MASTER (smiling): \"How much attention do you give to the world? Fifty
per cent?\" (Laughter.)</p>
<p>HOST: \"You know that, sir. We cannot achieve anything without the grace
of a holy person like yourself.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"If you please God, everyone will be pleased. It is God alone
that exists in the heart of the holy man.\"</p>
<p>HOST: \"Nothing, of course, remains unrealized when one attains God. If
a man attains God, he can give up everything else. If a man gets a
rupee, he gives up the joy of a penny.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"A little spiritual discipline is necessary. Through the
practice of discipline one gradually obtains divine joy. Suppose a jar
with money inside is hidden deep under the earth and someone wants to
possess it. In that case he must take the trouble of digging for it. As
he digs, he perspires. After much digging the spade strikes the metal
jar. He feels a thrill at the sound. The more sound the spade makes,
striking against the jar, the more joy he feels. \"Pray to Rāma.
Meditate on Him. He will certainly provide you with everything.\"</p>
<p>HOST: \"Revered sir, you are Rāma Himself.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"How is that? The waves belong to the river; does the river
belong to the waves?\"</p>
<p>HOST: \"Rāma dwells only in the hearts of holy men. He cannot be seen in
any other way. There is no Incarnation of God at the present time.\"</p>
<p>MASTER (smiling): \"How do you know there is no Divine Incarnation?\"</p>
<p>The host remained silent.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"All cannot recognize an Incarnation. When Nārada visited Rāma,
Rāma prostrated Himself before</p>
<p>Nārada and said: \'We are worldly creatures. How can we be sanctified
unless holy men like you visit us?\' Further, Rāma went into exile in
the forest to redeem His father\'s pledges. He saw that, since hearing
of His exile, the rishis of the forest had been fasting. Many of them
did not know that Rāma was none other than the Supreme Brahman.\"</p>
<p>HOST: \"You too are that same Rāma.\"</p>
<p><em>Ārati</em></p>
<p>MASTER: \"For heaven\'s sake! Never say that.\"</p>
<p>As, Sri Ramakrishna spoke these words, he bowed down to the host and
said, with folded hands: \" \'That Rāma dwells in all beings; He exists
everywhere in the universe. \"I am your servant. It is Rāma Himself who
has become all men, animals, and other living beings.\"</p>
<p>HOST: \"But sir, we do not know that.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Whether you know it or not, you are Rāma.\"</p>
<p>HOST: \"You are free from love and hatred.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"How so? I engaged a carriage to bring me to Calcutta and
advanced the coachman three <em>ānnās</em>. But he didn\'t turn up. I became
very angry with him. He is a very wicked man. He made me suffer a lot.\"</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna was resting. The Mārwāri devotees had been singing
bhajan on the roof. They were celebrating the Krishna festival.
Arrangements had been made for worship and food offering. At the host\'s
request the Master went to see the image. He bowed down before the
Deity.</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna was profoundly moved as he stood before the image. With
folded hands he said: \"O Govinda, Thou art my soul! Thou art my life!
Victory to Govinda! Hallowed be the name of Govinda! Thou art the
Embodiment of Satchidananda! Oh, Krishna! Ah, Krishna! Krishna is
knowledge. Krishna is mind. Krishna is life. Krishna is soul. Krishna is
body. Krishna is caste. Krishna is family. O Govinda, my life and
soul!\"</p>
<p>Uttering these words,\" Sri Ramakrishna went into samādhi. He remained
standing. Ram Chatterji supported him.</p>
<p>After a long time the Master regained consciousness of the world. The
Mārwāri devotees were about to take out the image. The offering of food
was to take place outside the room. The Master joined the procession of</p>
<p>devotees. The food was offered with and music. Sri Ramakrishna fanned
the image.</p>
<p>Then began the ceremony of feeding the brahmins. They were seated on the
roof. The Master and his devotees also partook of the prasad.</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna took leave of the host. It was evening and the street
was jammed as before with people and vehicles. He said: \"Let us get out
of the carriage. It can go by a back street.\" Proceeding on foot, he
found that a betel-leaf seller had opened his stall in front of a small
room that looked like a hole. One could not possibly enter it without
bending one\'s head. The Master said: \"How painful it is to be shut in
such a small space! That is the way of worldly people. And they are
happy in such a life.\"</p>
<p>The carriage came up after making the detour. The Master entered it with
Baburam, M., and Ram Chatterji.</p>
<p>The younger Gopal sat on the roof of the carriage.</p>
<p>A beggar woman with a baby on her arm stood in front of the carriage
waiting for alms. The Master said to M., \"Have you any money?\" Gopal
gave her something.</p>
<p>The carriage rolled along Burra bazar. Everywhere there were signs of
great festivity. The night was dark but illuminated with myriads of
lights. The carriage came to the Chitpur road, which was also brightly
lighted. The people moved in lines like ants. The crowd looked at the
gaily decorated stores and stalls on both sides of the road. There were
sweetmeat store and perfume stalls. Pictures, beautiful and gaudy, hung
from the walls. Well-dressed shopkeepers sprayed the visitors with
rose-water. The carriage stopped in front of a perfume stall. The Master
looked at the pictures and lights and felt happy like a child. People
were talking loudly. He cried out; \"Go forward! Move on!\" He laughed.
He said to Baburam with a loud laugh: \"Move on! What are you doing?\"
The devotees laughed too. They understood that the Master wanted them to
move forward to God and</p>
<p>not to be satisfied with their present state.</p>
<p>The carriage drove on. The Master noticed that M. had brought some
cloths for him. M. had with him two pieces of unbleached and two pieces
of washed cloth. But the Master had asked him only for the unbleached
ones. He said to M.: \"Give me the unbleached ones. You may keep the
others. All right. You may give me one of them.\"</p>
<ol>
<li>\"Then shall I take back one piece?\" MASTER: \"Then take both.\"</li>
</ol>

1.  \"As you please, sir.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"You can give me those when I need them. You see, yesterday
Beni Pāl wanted me to carry away some food for Ramlal. I told him I
couldn\'t. It is impossible for me to lay up for the future.\"</p>
<p>M: \'That\'s all right, sir. I shall take back the two pieces of washed
cloth.\"</p>
<p>MASTER (tenderly): \"Don\'t you see, if any desire arises in my mind, it
is for the good of you all? You are my own. I shall tell you if I need
anything.\"</p>
<p>M. (humbly): \"Yes, sir.\"</p>
<p>Referring to a devotee, Sri Ramakrishna said: \"I said to him yesterday,
\'Tomorrow I shall go to Burra bazar;</p>
<p>please meet me there.\' Do you know what he said? He said: The tram fare
will be one <em>ānnā</em>. Where shall I get it?\' He had been to Beni Pāl\'s
garden yesterday and had officiated there as priest. No one had asked
him to do it. He had put on the show himself. He wanted people to know
that he was a member of the Brahmo Samaj. (To M.) Can you tell me what
he meant when he said that the tram would cost him one <em>ānnā</em>?\"</p>
<p>The conversation turned to the Annakuta festival of the Mārwāris.</p>
<p>MASTER (to the devotees): \"What you have seen here one sees at
Vrindāvan too. Rākhāl has been seeing the same thing there. But the
mound of food at Vrindāvan is higher, and more people gather there.
There you also see the Govardhan hill. That\'s the only difference.</p>
<p>\"Did you notice the Mārwāris\' devotion? That is the real Hindu ideal.
That is the Sanatana Dharma. Did you notice their joy when they carried
the image in procession? They were happy to think that they bore the
throne of God on their shoulders.</p>
<p>\"The Hindu religion alone is the Sanatana Dharma. The various creeds
you hear of nowadays have come into existence through the will of God
and will disappear again through His will. They will not last forever.
Therefore I say, \'I bow down at the feet of even the modern devotees.\'
The Hindu religion has always existed and will always exist.\"</p>
<p>M. was going home. He saluted the Master and got out of the carriage
near Sobha bazar. Sri Ramakrishna proceeded to Dakshineswar in a happy
mood.</p>
