<p>THE FESTIVAL AT PĀNIHĀTI</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Monday, June 18, 1883</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Festival at Pānihāti</strong></p>
<p>SRI RAMAKRISHNA had been invited to the great religious festival at
Pānihāti, near Calcutta. This \"Festival of the Flattened Rice\" was
inaugurated by Raghunath Das, a disciple of Sri Chaitanya. It is said
that Raghunath used to run away from home, secretly practise his
devotions, and enjoy the bliss of spiritual ecstasy. One day Nityananda
said to him: \"Thief! You run away from home and enjoy the love of God
all alone. You hide it from us. I shall punish you today. You must
arrange a religious festival and entertain the devotees with flattened
rice.\" Since then the festival has been annually celebrated at Pānihāti
by the Vaishnavas. Thousands of the followers of Sri Chaitanya
participate in it. Its chief feature is the singing of the names and
glories of God, and the dancing of the devotees in religious fervour.
The centre of the festivity is the temple of Radha-Krishna, built on the
bank of the Ganges.</p>
<p>The Master had been invited to the festival by Mani Sen, who was the
custodian of the temple. Ram, M., Rākhāl , Bhavanath, and a few other
disciples went with the Master in a carriage. On his way to Pānihāti Sri
Ramakrishna was in a light mood and joked with the youngsters. But as
soon as the carriage reached the place of the festival, the Master, to
the utter amazement of\' the devotees, shot into the crowd. He joined
the kirtan party of Navadvip Goswami, Mani Sen\'s guru, and danced,
totally forgetting the world. Every now and then he stood still in
samādhi, carefully supported by Navadvip Goswami for fear he might fall
to the ground. Thousands of devotees were gathered together for the
festival. Wherever one looked there was a forest of human heads. The
crowd seemed to become infected by the Master\'s divine fervour and
swayed to and fro, chanting the name of God, until the very air seemed
to reverberate with it. Drums, cymbals, and other instruments produced
melodious sounds. The atmosphere became intense with spiritual fervour.
The devotees felt that Gaurānga himself was being manifested in the
person of Sri Ramakrishna. Flowers were showered from all sides on his
feet and head. The shouting of the name of Hari was heard even at a
distance, like the rumbling of the ocean.</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna entered by turn into all the moods of ecstasy. In deep
samādhi he stood still, his face radiating a divine glow. In the state
of partial consciousness he danced, sometimes gently and sometimes with
the vigour of a lion. Again, regaining consciousness of the world, he
sang, himself leading the chorus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Behold, the two brothers have come, who weep while chanting Hari\'s
name,</em></p>
<p><em>The brothers who dance in ecstasy and make the world dance in His
name!</em></p>
<p><em>Behold them, weeping themselves, and making the whole world weep as
well,</em></p>
<p><em>The brothers who, in return for blows, offer to sinners Hari\'s
love.</em></p>
<p><em>Behold them, drunk with Hari\'s love, who make the world drunk as
well!</em></p>
<p><em>Behold, the two brothers have come, who once were Kanai and Balai of
Braja,</em></p>
<p><em>They who would steal the butter out of the pots of the gopi maids.</em></p>
<p><em>Behold, the two have come, who shatter all the rules of caste,</em></p>
<p><em>Embracing everyone as brother, even the outcaste shunned by men;</em></p>
<p><em>Who lose themselves in Hari\'s name, making the whole world mad;</em></p>
<p><em>Who are none other than Hari Himself, and chant His hallowed name!</em></p>
<p><em>Behold them,who saved from their sinful ways the ruffians Jagai and
Madhai,</em></p>
<p><em>They who cannot distinguish between a friend and an enemy!</em></p>
<p><em>Behold the two brothers, Gaur and Nitai, who come again to save
mankind.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again the Master sang:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>See how all Nadia is shaking</em></p>
<p><em>Under the waves of Gaurānga\'s love! . . .</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The crowd, with the Master in the centre, surged toward the temple of
Radha-Krishna. Only a small number could enter. The rest stood outside
the portal and jostled with one another to have a look at Sri
Ramakrishna. In a mood of intoxication he began to dance in the
courtyard of the shrine. Every now and then his body stood transfixed in
deep samādhi. Hundreds of people around him shouted the name of God, and
thousands outside caught the strain and raised the cry with
full-throated voices. The echo travelled over the Ganges, striking a
note in the hearts of people in the boats on the holy river, and they
too chanted the name of God.</p>
<p>When the kirtan was over, Mani Sen took Sri Ramakrishna and Navadvip
Goswami into a room and served them with refreshments. Afterwards Ram,
M., and the other devotees were also served with the prasad.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the Master was sitting in Mani Sen\'s drawing-room
with the devotees. Navadvip was also near him. Mani offered the carriage
hire to Sri Ramakrishna. Pointing to Ram and the others, the Master
said: \"Why should they accept it from you? They earn money.\" He became
engaged in conversation with Navadvip.</p>
<p><strong>Different states of bhakti</strong></p>
<p>MASTER: \"Bhakti matured becomes bhava. Next is mahabhava, then prema,
and last of all is the attainment of God. Gaurānga experienced the
states of mahabhava and prema. When prema is awakened, a devotee
completely forgets the world; he also forgets his body, which is so dear
to a man. Gaurānga experienced prema. He jumped into the ocean, thinking
it to be the Jamuna. The ordinary jiva does not experience mahabhava or
prema. He goes only as far as bhava. But Gaurānga experienced all three
states. Isn\'t that so?\"</p>
<p>NAVADVIP: \"Yes, sir, that is true. The inmost state, the semi-conscious
state, and the conscious state.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"In the inmost state he would remain in samādhi, unconscious of
the outer world. In the semi-conscious state he could only dance. In the
conscious state he chanted the name of God.\"</p>
<p>Navadvip introduced his son to the Master. The young man was a student
of the scriptures. He saluted Sri Ramakrishna.</p>
<p>NAVADVIP: \"He studies the scriptures at home. Previously one hardly saw
a copy of the Vedas in this country. Max Muller has translated them; so
people can now read these books.\"</p>
<p><strong>Essence of the scriptures</strong></p>
<p>MASTER: \"Too much study of the scriptures does more harm than good. The
important thing is to know the essence of the scriptures. After that,
what is the need of books? One should learn the essence and then dive
deep in order to realize God.</p>
<p><strong>Ideal of the Gitā</strong></p>
<p>\"The Divine Mother has revealed to me the essence of the Vedānta. It is
that Brahman alone is real and the world illusory. The essence of the
Gitā is what you get by repeating the word ten times. The word becomes
reversed. It is then \'tagi\', which refers to renunciation. The essence
of the Gitā is: \'O man, renounce everything and practise spiritual
discipline for the realization of God.\' \"</p>
<p>NAVADVIP: \"But how can we persuade our minds to renounce?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"You are a goswami. It is your duty to officiate as priest in
the temple. You cannot renounce the world; otherwise, who would look
after the temple and its services? You have to renounce mentally.</p>
<p>\"It is God Himself who has kept you in the world to set an example to
men. You may resolve in your mind a</p>
<p>thousand times to renounce the world, but you will not succeed. God has
given you such a nature that you must perform your worldly duties.</p>
<p>\"Krishna said to Arjuna: \'What do you mean, you will not fight? By
your mere will you cannot desist from fighting. Your very nature will
make you fight.\' \"</p>
<p>At the mere mention of Krishna and Arjuna the Master went into samādhi.
In the twinkling of an eye his body became motionless and his eyeballs
transfixed, while his breathing could scarcely be noticed. At this
sudden transformation Navadvip and his son and the other devotees looked
at the Master in mute wonder.</p>
<p>Regaining partial consciousness, he said to Navadvip: \"Yoga and bhoga.
You goswamis have both. Now your only duty is to call on God and pray to
Him sincerely: \'O God, I don\'t want the glories of Thy
world-bewitching maya. I want Thee alone!\' God dwells in all beings,
undoubtedly. That being the case, who may be called His devotee? He who
dwells in God, he who has merged his mind and life and innermost soul in
God.\"</p>
<p>The Master returned to the sense plane. Referring to his samādhi, he
said to Navadvip: \"Some say that this state of mine is a disease. I say
to them, \'How can one become unconscious by thinking of Him whose
Consciousness has made the whole world conscious?\' \"</p>
<p>Mani Sen said good-bye to the invited brahmins and Vaishnavas with
suitable gifts of money. He offered five rupees to Sri Ramakrishna. The
latter said that he could not possibly accept any money. But Mani
insisted. The Master then asked him in the name of his guru not to press
him. Mani requested him again to accept the offering. Sri Ramakrishna
asked M., in a distressed voice, whether he should take the money. The
disciple made a vehement protest and said, \"No, sir. By no means.\"</p>
<p>Friends of Mani Sen gave the money to Rākhāl , requesting him to buy
some mangoes and sweets for the Master. Sri Ramakrishna said to M.: \"I
have definitely said to Mani that I would not accept the money. I feel
free now. But Rākhāl has accepted it. His is now the responsibility.\"</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna, accompanied by the devotees, took a carriage to return
to Dakshineswar. They were going to pass the temple garden of Mati Seal
on the way. For a long time the Master had been asking M. to take him to
the reservoir in the garden in order that he might teach him how to
meditate on the formless God. There were tame fish in the reservoir.
Nobody harmed them. Visitors threw puffed rice and other bits of food
into the water, and the big fish came in swarms to eat the food.
Fearlessly the fish swam in the water and sported there joyously.</p>
<p>Coming to the reservoir, the Master said to M.: \"Look at the fish.
Meditating on the formless God is like swimming joyfully like these
fish, in the Ocean of Bliss and Consciousness.\"</p>
<p><strong>Monday, June 25, 1883</strong></p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna was at Balarām Bose\'s house in Calcutta. Rākhāl and M.
were seated near him. The Master was in ecstasy. He conversed with the
devotees in an abstracted mood.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Let me assure you that a man can realize his Inner Self
through sincere prayer. But to the extent that he has the desire to
enjoy worldly objects, his vision of the Self becomes obstructed.\"</p>
<p>M: \"Yes, sir. You always ask us to plunge into God.\"</p>
<p>MASTER (joyously): \"Yes! That\'s it. Let me tell you that the
realization of Self is possible for all, without any exception.\"</p>
<ol>
<li>\"That is true, sir. But God is the Doer. He works through different
    beings in different ways, according to their capacity to manifest
    the Divine. God gives to some full spiritual consciousness, and
    others He keeps in ignorance.\"</li>
</ol>
<p>MASTER: \"No, that is not so. One should pray to God with a longing
heart. God certainly listens to prayer if it is sincere. There is no
doubt about it.\"</p>
<p>A DEVOTEE: \"Yes, sir. There is this \'I-consciousness\' in us;
therefore we must pray.\"</p>
<p><strong>Nitya and Lila</strong></p>
<p>MASTER (to M.): \"A man should reach the Nitya, the Absolute, by
following the trail of the Lila, the Relative. It is like reaching the
roof by the stairs. After realizing the Absolute, he should climb down
to the Relative and live on that plane in the company of devotees,
charging his mind with the love of God. This is my final and most mature
opinion.</p>
<p>\"God has different forms, and He sports in different ways. He sports as
Isvara, deva, man, and the universe. In every age He descends to earth
in human form, as an Incarnation, to teach people love and devotion.
There is the instance of Chaitanya. One can taste devotion and love of
God only through His Incarnations. Infinite are the ways of God\'s play,
but what I need is love and devotion. I want only the milk. The milk
comes through the udder of the cow. The Incarnation is the udder.\"</p>
<p>Was Sri Ramakrislma hinting that he was an Incarnation of God? Did he
suggest that those who saw him saw God? Did he thus speak about himself
when speaking of Chaitanya?</p>
<p>It was a hot day in June 1883. Sri Ramakrishna was sitting on the steps
of the Śiva temples in the temple garden. M. arrived with ice and other
offerings and sat down on the steps after saluting the Master.</p>
<p>MASTER (to M.): \"The husband of Mani Mallick\'s granddaughter was here.
He read in a book that God could not be said to be quite wise and
omniscient; otherwise, why should there be so much misery in the world?
As regards death, it would be much better to kill a man all at once,
instead of putting him through slow torture. Further, the author writes
that if he himself were the Creator, he would have created a better
world.\"</p>
<p>M. listened to these words in surprise and made no comment.</p>
<p><strong>The ways of God are inscrutable</strong></p>
<p>MASTER (to M.): \"Can a man ever understand God\'s ways? I too think of
God sometimes as good and sometimes as bad. He has kept us deluded by
His great illusion. Sometimes He wakes us up and sometimes He keeps us
unconscious. One moment the ignorance disappears, and the next moment it
covers our mind. If you throw a brick-bat into a pond covered with moss,
you get a glimpse of the water. But a few moments later the moss comes
dancing back and covers the water.</p>
<p><strong>Body-consciousness produces duality</strong></p>
<p>\"One is aware of pleasure and pain, birth and death, disease and grief,
as long as one is identified with the body. All these belong to the body
alone, and not to the Soul. After the death of the body, perhaps God
carries one to a better place. It is like the birth of the child after
the pain of delivery. Attaining Self-Knowledge, one looks on pleasure
and pain, birth and death, as a dream.</p>
<p>\"How little we know! Can a one-seer pot hold ten seers of milk? If ever
a salt doll ventures into the ocean to measure its depth, it cannot come
back and give us the information. It melts into the water and
disappears.\"</p>
<p>At dusk the evening service began in the different temples. The Master
was sitting on the small couch in his room, absorbed in contemplation of
the Divine Mother. Several devotees also were there. M. was going to
spend the night with the Master.</p>
<p>A little later Sri Ramakrishna began to talk to a devotee privately, on
the verandah north of his room. He said: \"It is good to meditate in the
small hours of the morning and at dawn. One should also meditate daily
after dusk.\" He instructed the devotee about meditation on the Personal
God and on the Impersonal Reality.</p>
<p>After a time he sat on the semicircular porch west of his room. It was
about nine o\'clock.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Those who come here will certainly have all their doubts
removed. What do you say?\"</p>
<p>M: \"That is true, sir.\"</p>
<p>A boat was moving in the Ganges, far away from the bank. The boatman
began to sing. The sound of his voice floating over the river reached
the Master\'s ears, and he went into a spiritual mood. The hair on his
body stood on end. He said to M., \"Just feel my body.\" M. was greatly
amazed. He thought: \"The Upanishads describe Brahman as permeating the
universe and the ether. Has that Brahman, as sound, touched the
Master\'s body?\"</p>
<p>After a time Sri Ramakrishna began to converse again.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Those who come here must have been born with good tendencies.
Isn\'t that true?\"</p>
<p>M: \"It is true, sir.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Adhar must have good tendencies.\"</p>
<p>M: \"That goes without saying.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"A guileless man easily realizes God. There are two paths: the
path of righteousness and the path of wickedness. One should follow the
path of righteousness.\"</p>
<ol>
<li>\"That is true, sir. If a thread has a single fibre sticking out, it
    cannot pass through the eye of a needle.\" MASTER: \"If a man finds
    a hair in the food he is chewing, he spits out the entire morsel.\"</li>
</ol>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
23. \"But you say that the man who has realized God cannot be injured by
    evil company. A blazing fire burns up even a plantain-tree.\"</p>
<p><strong>Saturday, July 14, 1883</strong></p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna arrived at Adhar\'s house in Calcutta. Rākhāl , M., and
other devotees were with the Master.</p>
<p>Adhar had arranged to have Rajnarayan, the famous singer, and his party,
recite the Chandi.</p>
<p>Rajnarayan began the recital in the worship hall. He sang:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I have surrendered my soul at the fearless feet of the Mother; Am I
afraid of Death any more? . . .</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the Master listened, he became filled with divine fervour and joined
the musicians. Now and then he improvised an appropriate line. Suddenly
he went into samādhi and stood still.</p>
<p>The singer sang again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Who is the Woman yonder who lights the field of battle? Darker Her
body gleams even than the darkest storm-cloud, And from Her teeth
there flash the lightning\'s blinding flames! Dishevelled Her hair is
flying behind as She rushes about, Undaunted in this war between the
gods and the demons. Laughing Her terrible laugh, She slays the
fleeing asuras, And with Her dazzling flashes She bares the horror of
war. How beautiful on Her brow the drops of moisture appear! About Her
dense black hair the bees are buzzing in swarms; The moon has veiled
its face, beholding this Sea of Beauty.</em></p>
<p><em>Tell me, who can She be, this Sorceress? Wonder of wonders! Śiva
Himself, like a corpse, lies vanquished at Her feet. Kamalakanta has
guessed who She is, with the elephant\'s gait; She is none other than
Kāli, Mother of all the worlds. Sri Ramakrishna was in deep samādhi.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Saturday, July 21, 1883</strong></p>
<p>It was about four o\'clock in the afternoon when Sri Ramakrishna, with
Ramlal and one or two other devotees, started from Dakshineswar for
Calcutta in a carriage. As the carriage passed the gate of the Kāli
temple, they met M. coming on foot with four mangoes in his hand. The
carriage stopped and M. saluted the Master. Sri Ramakrishna was going to
visit some of his devotees in Calcutta.</p>
<p>MASTER (to M., with a smile): \"Come with us. We are going to Adhar\'s
house.\"</p>
<p>M. got joyfully into the carriage. Having received an English education,
he did not believe in the tendencies inherited from previous births. But
he had admitted a few days before that it was on account of Adhar\'s
good tendencies from past births that he showed such great devotion to
the Master. Later on he had thought about this subject and had
discovered that he was not yet completely convinced about inherited
tendencies. He had come to Dakshineswar that day to discuss the matter
with Sri Ramakrishna.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Well, what do you think of Adhar?\"</p>
<p>M: \"He has great yearning for God.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Adhar, too, speaks very highly of you.\"</p>
<p>M. remained silent awhile and then began to speak of past tendencies.</p>
<p>M: \"I haven\'t much faith in rebirth and inherited tendencies. Will
that in any way injure my devotion to God?\"</p>
<p><strong>Everything is possible for God</strong></p>
<p>MASTER: \"It is enough to believe that all is possible in God\'s
creation. Never allow the thought to cross your mind that your ideas are
the only true ones, and that those of others are false. Then God will
explain everything.</p>
<p>\"What can a man understand of God\'s activities? The facets of God\'s
creation are infinite. I do not try to understand God\'s actions at all.
I have heard that everything is possible in God\'s creation, and I
always bear that in mind. Therefore I do not give a thought to the
world, but meditate on God alone. Once Hanuman was asked, \'What day of
the lunar month is it?\' Hanuman said: \'I don\'t know anything about
the day of the month, the position of the moon and stars, or any such
things. I think of Rāma alone.\'</p>
<p>\"Can one ever understand the work of God? He is so near; still it is
not possible for us to know Him. Balarama did not realize that Krishna
was God.\"</p>
<p>M: \"That is true, sir.\"</p>
<p><strong>Maya is the cause of ignorance</strong></p>
<p>MASTER: \"God has covered all with His maya. He doesn\'t let us know
anything. Maya is \'woman and gold\'. He who puts maya aside to see God,
can see Him. Once, when I was explaining God\'s actions to someone, God
suddenly showed me the lake at Kamarpukur. I saw a man removing the
green scum and drinking the water. The water was clear as crystal. God
revealed to me that Satchidananda is covered by the scum of maya. He who
puts the green scum aside can drink the water.</p>
<p>\"Let me tell you a very secret experience. Once I had entered the wood
near the pine-grove, and was sitting</p>
<p>there, when I had a vision of something like the hidden door of a
chamber. I couldn\'t see the inside of the chamber. I tried to bore a
hole in the door with a nail-knife, but did not succeed. As I bored, the
earth fell back into the hole and filled it. Then suddenly I made a very
big opening.\"</p>
<p>Uttering these words, the Master remained silent. After a time he said:
\"These are very profound words. I feel as if someone were pressing my
mouth. . . . I have seen with my own eyes that God dwells even in the
sexual organ. I saw Him once in the sexual intercourse of a dog and a
bitch.</p>
<p>\"The universe is conscious on account of the Consciousness of God.
Sometimes I find that this Consciousness wriggles about, as it were,
even in small fish.\"</p>
<p>The carriage came to the crossing at Shovabazar in Calcutta. The Master
continued, saying, \"Sometimes I find that the universe is saturated
with the Consciousness of God, as the earth is soaked with water in the
rainy season.</p>
<p>\"Well, I see so many visions, but I never feel vain about them.\"</p>
<p>M. (with a smile): \"That you should speak of vanity, sir!\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Upon my word, I don\'t feel vanity even in the slightest
degree.\"</p>
<ol>
<li>\"There once lived a man in Greece, Socrates by name. A voice from
    heaven said that he was wise among men. Socrates was amazed at this
    revelation. He meditated on it a long time in solitude and then
    realized its significance. He said to his friends, \'I alone of all
    people have understood that I do not know anything.\' But every man
    believes he is wise. In reality all are ignorant.\"</li>
</ol>
<p>MASTER: \"Now and then I think, \'What is it I know that makes so many
people come to me?\' Vaishnavcharan</p>
<p>was a great pundit. He used to say to me: \'I can find in the scriptures
all the things you talk about. But do you know why I come to you? I come
to hear them from your mouth.\' \"</p>
<ol>
<li>\"All your words tally with the scriptures. Navadvip Goswami also
    said that the other day at the festival at Pānihāti. You told us
    that day that by repeating the word \'Gitā\' a number of times one
    reverses it and it becomes \'tagi\', which refers to renunciation.
    Renunciation is the essence of the Gitā. Navadvip Goswami supported
    your statement from the grammatical standpoint.\"</li>
</ol>
<p>MASTER: \"Have you found anyone else resembling me-any pundit or holy
man?\"</p>
<ol>
<li>\"God has created you with His own hands, whereas He has made others
    by machine. All others He has created according to law.\"</li>
</ol>
<p>MASTER (laughing, to Ramlal and the other devotees): \"Listen to what he
is saying!\"</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna laughed for some time, and said at last. \"Really and
truly I have no pride-no, not even the slightest bit.\"</p>
<ol>
<li>\"Knowledge does us good in one respect at least; it makes us feel
    that we do not know anything, that we are nothing.\"</li>
</ol>
<p>MASTER: \"Right you are! I am nothing. I am nobody. \"Do you believe in
English astronomy?\"</p>
<ol>
<li>\"It is possible to make new discoveries by applying the laws of
    Western astronomy. Observing the irregular movement of Uranus, the
    astronomers looked through their telescopes and discovered Neptune
    shining in the sky. They can also foretell eclipses.\"</li>
</ol>
<p>MASTER: \"Yes, that is so.\"</p>
<p><strong>Master\'s visits to various devotees</strong></p>
<p>The carriage drove on. They were approaching Adhar\'s house. Sri
Ramakrishna said to M., \"Dwell in the truth and you will certainly
realize God.\"</p>
<ol>
<li>\"You said the other day to Navadvip Goswami:\'O God, I want Thee.
    Please do not delude me with Thy world-bewitching maya. I want to
    realize Thee.\' \"</li>
</ol>
<p>MASTER: \"Yes, one should be able to say that from one\'s innermost
soul.\"</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna arrived at Adhar\'s house and took a seat in the
parlour. Ramlal, Adhar, M., and the other devotees sat near him. Rākhāl
was staying with his father in Calcutta.</p>
<p>MASTER (to Adhar): \" Didn\'t you let Rākhāl know that I was coming?\"</p>
<p>ADHAR: \"Yes, sir. I have sent him word.\"</p>
<p>Finding that the Master was eager to see Rākhāl , Adhar at once sent his
carriage to fetch him. Adhar had been yearning to see the Master that
day, but he had not definitely known that Sri Ramakrishna was coming.</p>
<p>ADHAR: \"You haven\'t been here for a long time. I prayed to God today
that you might come. I even shed tears\"</p>
<p>The Master was pleased and said with a smile, \"You don\'t mean that!\"</p>
<p>It was dusk and the lamps were lighted. Sri Ramakrishna saluted the
Divine Mother with folded hands and sat quietly absorbed in meditation.
Then he began to chant the names of God in his sweet voice: \"Govinda!
Govinda! Satchidananda! Hari! Hari!\" Every word he uttered showered
nectar on the ears of the devotees.</p>
<p>Ramlal sang in praise of Kāli, the Divine Mother:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Thy name, I have heard, O Consort of Śiva, is the destroyer of our
fear,</em></p>
<p><em>And so on Thee I cast my burden: Save me! Save me, O kindly Mother!</em></p>
<p><em>Out of Thy womb the world is born, and Thou it is that dost pervade
it.</em></p>
<p><em>Art Thou Kāli? Art Thou Radha? Who can ever rightly say?</em></p>
<p><em>Mother, in every living creature Thou dost have Thy dwelling place;</em></p>
<p><em>As Kundalini Thou dost live in the lotus of the Muladhara.</em></p>
<p><em>Above it lies the Svadhisthana, where the four-petalled lotus
blooms;</em></p>
<p><em>There also Thou dost make Thy home, O mystic power of Kundalini,</em></p>
<p><em>In the four petals of that flower, and in Vajrasana\'s six petals</em></p>
<p><em>At the navel is Manipura, the blue ten-petalled lotus flower;</em></p>
<p><em>Through the pathway of Sushumna, Thou dost ascend and enter there.</em></p>
<p><em>O Lady of the lotuses, in lotus blossoms Thou dost dwell!</em></p>
<p><em>Beyond them lies the Lake of Nectar, in the region of the heart,</em></p>
<p><em>Where the twelve-petalled lotus flower enchants the eye with scarlet
flame.</em></p>
<p><em>When Thou dost open it, O Mother, touching it with Thy Lotus Feet,</em></p>
<p><em>The age-long darkness of the heart instantly scatters at Thy sight.</em></p>
<p><em>Above, in the throat, is the sixteen-petalled lotus flower, of smoky
hue;</em></p>
<p><em>Within the petals of this flower there lies concealed a subtle
space,</em></p>
<p><em>Transcending which, one sees at length the universe in Space
dissolve.</em></p>
<p><em>And higher yet, between the eyebrows, blossoms the lotus of two
petals,</em></p>
<p><em>Where the mind of man remains a prisoner and past controlling;</em></p>
<p><em>From this flower the mind desires to watch the sportive play of
life.</em></p>
<p><em>Highest of all, within the head, the soul-enthralling centre is,</em></p>
<p><em>Where shines the thousand-petalled lotus, Mahadeva\'s dwelling
place.</em></p>
<p><em>Having ascended to His throne, O Spouse of Śiva, sit beside Him!</em></p>
<p><em>Thou art the Primal Power, O Mother! She whose senses are
controlled;</em></p>
<p><em>The yogis meditate on Thee as Uma, great Himalaya\'s daughter.</em></p>
<p><em>Thou who art the Power of Śiva! Put to death my ceaseless cravings;</em></p>
<p><em>Grant that I never fall again into the ocean of this world.</em></p>
<p><em>Mother, Thou art the Primal Power, Thou the five cosmic principles;</em></p>
<p><em>Who can ever hope to know Thee, who art beyond all principles?</em></p>
<p><em>Only for Thy bhaktas\' sake dost Thou assume Thy various forms;</em></p>
<p><em>But when Thy devotee\'s five senses merge in the five elements,</em></p>
<p><em>Mother, it is Thyself alone that he beholds as formless Truth.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As Ramlal sang the lines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Above, in the throat, is the sixteen-petalled lotus flower, of smoky
hue;</em></p>
<p><em>Within the petals of this flower there lies concealed a subtle
space,</em></p>
<p><em>Transcending which, one sees at length the universe in Space
dissolve,</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Master said to M.: \"Listen. This is known as the vision of
Satchidananda, the Formless Brahman. The Kundalini, rising above the
Visuddha chakra, enables one to see everything as Ākāśa.\"</p>
<p>M: \"Yes, sir.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"One attains the Absolute by going beyond the universe and its
created beings conjured up by maya. By passing beyond the Nada one goes
into samādhi. By repeating \'Om\' one goes beyond the Nada and attains
samādhi.\"</p>
<p>Adhar served Sri Ramakrishna with fruits and sweets. The Master left for
Jadu Mallick\'s house.</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna entered the room in Jadu\'s house where the Divine
Mother was worshipped. He stood before the image, which had been
decorated with flowers, garlands, and sandal-paste, and which radiated a
heavenly beauty and splendour. Lights were burning before the pedestal.
A priest was seated before the image. The Master asked one of his
companions to offer a rupee in the shrine, according to the Hindu
custom.</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna stood a long time with folded hands before the blissful
image, the devotees standing behind him. Gradually he went into samādhi,
his body becoming motionless and his eyes fixed.</p>
<p>With a long sigh he came back to the world of the \"Mother, good-bye.\"
But he could not leave the place. said: \"Please sing that song. Then I
shall be all right.\"</p>
<p>Ramlal sang:</p>
<p>senses and said, still intoxicated with divine fervour, He remained
standing there. Addressing Ramlal, he</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>O Mother, Consort of Śiva, Thou hast deluded this world. . . .</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Master went to the drawing-room with the devotees. Every now and
then he said, \"O Mother, please dwell in my heart.\" Jadu was sitting
in the drawing-room with his friends. The Master sat down, still in an
ecstatic mood, and sang:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>O Mother, ever blissful as Thou art,</em></p>
<p><em>Do not deprive Thy worthless child of bliss! . . .</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finishing the song, he said to Jadu, still in a state of divine fervour:
\"Well, sir, what shall I sing? Shall I sing \'Mother, am I Thine
eight-months child\'? \"</p>
<p>He sang:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Mother, am I Thine eight-months child? Thy red eyes cannot frighten
me!</em></p>
<p><em>My riches are Thy Lotus Feet, which Śiva holds upon His breast;</em></p>
<p><em>Yet, when I seek my heritage, I meet with excuses and delays.</em></p>
<p><em>A deed of gift I hold in my heart, attested by Thy Husband Śiva;</em></p>
<p><em>I shall sue Thee, if I must, and with a single point shall win.</em></p>
<p><em>If Thou dost oppose me, Thou wilt learn what sort of mother\'s son I
am.</em></p>
<p><em>This bitterly contested suit between the Mother and Her son-</em></p>
<p><em>What sport it is! says Ramprasad. I shall not cease tormenting Thee</em></p>
<p><em>Till Thou Thyself, shalt yield the fight and take me in Thine arms at
last.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Coming down nearly to a normal state, the Master said, \"I shall take
some of the Divine Mother\'s prasad.\" Then he ate a little of it.</p>
<p>Jadu Mallick was sitting near him with several friends, among whom were
a few of his flatterers.</p>
<p>MASTER (with a smile): \"Well, why do you keep these buffoons with
you?\"</p>
<p>JADU (with a smile): \"Suppose they are. Won\'t you redeem them?\"</p>
<p>MASTER (smiling): \"The water of the Ganges cannot purify a wine-jar.\"</p>
<p>Jadu had promised the Master that he would arrange a recital of the
Chandi in his house. Some time had elapsed, but he had not yet kept his
promise.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Well, what about the recital of the Chandi?\"</p>
<p>JADU: \"I have been busy with many things; I haven\'t been able to
arrange it.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"How is that? A man gives his word and doesn\'t take it back!
\'The words of a man are like the tusks</p>
<p>of the elephant: they come out but do not go back.\' A man must be true
to his word. What do you say?\"</p>
<p>JADU (with a smile): \"You are right.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"You are a shrewd man. You do a thing after much calculation.
You are like the brahmin who selects a cow that eats very little,
supplies plenty of dung, and gives much milk.\" (All laugh.)</p>
<p>After a time he said to Jadu: \"I now understand your nature. It is half
warm and half cold. You are devoted to God and also to the world.\"</p>
<p>The Master and his devotees were served by Jadu with sweets and fruit,
and then the party left for the home of Khelat Ghosh.</p>
<p>Khelat Ghosh\'s house was a big mansion, but it looked deserted. As the
Master entered the house he fell into an ecstatic mood. M., Ramlal, and
a few other devotees were with him. Their host was Khelat Ghosh\'s
brother-in-law. He was an old man, a Vaishnava. His body was stamped
with the name of God, according to the Vaishnava custom, and he carried
in his hand a small bag containing his rosary. He had visited the
Master, now and then, at Dakshineswar. But most of the Vaishnavas held
narrow religious views; they criticized the Vedantists and the followers
of the Śiva cult. Sri Ramakrishna soon began to speak.</p>
<p><strong>Dogmatism condemned</strong></p>
<p>MASTER: \"It is not good to feel that one\'s own religion alone is true
and all others are false. God is one only,</p>
<p>and not two. Different people call on Him by different names: some as
Allah, some as God, and others as Krishna, Śiva, and Brahman. It is like
the water in a lake. Some drink it at one place and call it \'jal\',
others at another place and call it \'pani\', and still others at a
third place and call it \'water\'. The Hindus call it \'jal\', the
Christians \'water\', and the Mussalmans \'pani\'. But it is one and the
same thing. Opinions are but paths. Each</p>
<p>religion is only a path leading to God, as rivers come from different
directions and ultimately become one in the one ocean.</p>
<p><strong>Oneness of God</strong></p>
<p>\"The Truth established in the Vedas, the Puranas, and the Tantras is
but one Satchidananda. In the Vedas It is called Brahman, in the Puranas
It is called Krishna, Rāma, and so on, and in the Tantras It is called
Śiva. The one Satchidananda is called Brahman, Krishna, and Śiva.\"</p>
<p>The devotees were silent.</p>
<p>A VAISHNAVA DEVOTEE: \"Sir, why should one think of God at all\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"If a man really has that knowledge, then he is indeed
liberated though living in a body.</p>
<p><strong>Shallow faith of the worldly-minded</strong></p>
<p>\"Not all, by any means, believe in God. They simply talk. The
worldly-minded have heard from someone that God exists and that
everything happens by His will; but it is not their inner belief.</p>
<p>\"Do you know what a worldly man\'s idea of God is like? It is like the
children\'s swearing by God when they quarrel. They have heard the word
while listening to their elderly aunts quarreling.</p>
<p>\"Is it possible for all to comprehend God? God has created the good and
the bad, the devoted and the impious, the faithful and the sceptical.
The wonders that we see all exist in His creation. In one place there is
more manifestation of His Power, in another less. The sun\'s light is
better reflected by water than by earth, and still better by a mirror.
Again, there are different levels among the devotees of God: superior,
mediocre, and inferior. All this has been described in the Gitā.\"</p>
<p>VAISHNAVA: \"True, sir.\"</p>
<p><strong>Various classes of devotees</strong></p>
<p>MASTER: \"The inferior devotee says, \'God exists, but He is very far
off, up there in heaven.\' The mediocre devotee says, \'God exists in
all beings as life and consciousness.\' The superior devotee says: \'It
is God Himself who has become everything; whatever I see is only a form
of God. It is He alone who has become maya, the universe, and all living
beings. Nothing exists but God.\' \"</p>
<p>VAISHNAVA: \"Does anyone ever attain that state of mind?\"</p>
<p><strong>Signs of God-vision</strong></p>
<p>MASTER: \"One cannot attain it unless one has seen God. But there are
signs that a man has had the vision of</p>
<p>God. A man who has seen God sometimes behaves like a madman: he laughs,
weeps, dances, and sings. Sometimes he behaves like a child, a child
five years old-guileless, generous, without vanity, unattached to
anything, not under the control of any of the gunas, always blissful.
Sometimes he behaves like a ghoul: he doesn\'t differentiate between
things pure and things impure; he sees no difference between things
clean and things unclean. And sometimes he is like an inert thing,
staring vacantly: he cannot do any work; he cannot strive for
anything.\"</p>
<p>Was the Master making a veiled reference to his own states of mind?</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge and ignorance</strong></p>
<p>MASTER (to the Vaishnava devotee): \"The feeling of \'Thee and Thine\'
is the outcome of Knowledge; \'I and</p>
<p>mine\' comes from ignorance. Knowledge makes one feel: \'O God, Thou art
the Doer and I am Thy instrument.</p>
<p>O God, to Thee belongs all-body, mind, house, family, living beings, and
the universe. All these are Thine. Nothing belongs to me.\'</p>
<p>\"An ignorant person says, \'Oh, God is there-very far off.\' The man of
Knowledge knows that God is right here, very near, in the heart; that He
has assumed all forms and dwells in all hearts as their Inner
Controller.\"</p>
<p><strong>Sunday, July 22, 1883</strong></p>
<p>Taking advantage of the holiday, many householder devotees visited Sri
Ramakrishna in his room at the Dakshineswar temple garden. The Young
devotees, mostly students, generally came on week-days. Sometimes the
Master asked his intimate disciples to come on a Tuesday or a Saturday,
days that he considered very auspicious for special religious
instruction. Adhar, Rākhāl , and M. had come from Calcutta in a hired
carriage.</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna had enjoyed a little rest after his midday meal. The
room had an atmosphere of purity and holiness. On the walls hung
pictures of gods and goddesses, among them one of Christ rescuing the
drowning Peter. Outside the room were plants laden with fragrant
flowers, and the Ganges could be seen flowing toward the south. The
Master was seated on the small couch, facing the north, and the devotees
sat on mats and carpets spread on the floor. All eyes were directed
toward him. Mani Mallick, an old Brahmo devotee about sixty-five years
of age, came to pay his respects to the Master. He had returned a few
months earlier from a pilgrimage to Benares and was recounting his
experiences to Sri Ramakrishna.</p>
<p><strong>Difficulty of the Vedantic method</strong></p>
<p>MANI MALLICK: \"A monk whom I met in Benares said that no religious
experience is possible without the control of the sense-organs. Nothing
could be achieved by merely crying, \'God! God!\' \"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Do you understand the views of teachers like him? According to
them, one must first practise spiritual discipline: self-restraint,
self-control, forbearance, and the like. Their aim is to attain Nirvāna.
They are followers of Vedānta. They constantly discriminate, saying,
\'Brahman alone is real, and the world illusory.\' But this is an
extremely difficult path. If the world is illusory, then you too are
illusory. The teacher who gives the instruction is equally illusory. His
words, too, are as illusory as a dream.</p>
<p>\"But this experience is beyond the reach of the ordinary man. Do you
know what it is like? If you burn camphor nothing remains. When wood is
burnt at least a little ash is left. Finally, after the last analysis,
the devotee goes into samādhi. Then he knows nothing whatsoever of
\'I\', \'you\', or the universe.</p>
<p>\"Padmalochan was a man of deep wisdom. He had great respect for me,
though at that time I constantly repeated the name of the Divine Mother.
He was the court pundit of the Maharaja of Burdwan. Once he came to
Calcutta and went to live in a garden house near kamarhati. I felt a
desire to see him and sent Hriday there to learn if the pundit had any
vanity. I was told that he had none. Then I met him. Though a man of
great knowledge and scholarship, he began to weep on hearing me sing
Ramprasad\'s devotional songs. We talked together a long while;
conversation with nobody else gave me such satisfaction. He said to me,
\'Give up the desire for the company of devotees; otherwise people of
all sorts will come to you and make you deviate from your spiritual
ideal.\' Once he entered into a controversy, by correspondence, with
Utshavananda, Vaishnavcharan\'s guru. He told me an interesting
incident. Once a meeting was called to decide which of the two deities,
Śiva or Brahma, was the greater. Unable to come to any decision, the
pundits at last referred the matter to Padmalochan. With characteristic
guilelessness he said: \'How do I know? Neither I nor any of my
ancestors back to the fourteenth generation have seen Śiva or Brahma.\'
About the renunciation of \'woman and gold\', he said to me one day:
\'Why have you given up those things? Such distinctions as \"This is
money and that is clay\" are the outcome of ignorance.\' What could I
say to that? I replied: \'I don\'t know all these things, my dear sir.
But for my part, I cannot relish such things as money and the like.\'</p>
<p>\"There was a pundit who was tremendously vain. He did not believe in
the forms of God. But who can understand the inscrutable ways of the
Divine? God revealed Himself to him as the Primal Power. This vision
made the pundit unconscious for a long time. After regaining partial
consciousness he uttered only the sound \'Ka! Ka! Ka!\' He could not
fully pronounce \'Kāli\'.\"</p>
<p>A DEVOTEE: \"Sir, you met Pundit Vidyasagar. What did you think of
him?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Vidyasagar has both scholarship and charity, but he lacks
inner vision. Gold lies hidden within him. Had he but found it out, his
activities would have been reduced; finally they would have stopped
altogether. Had he but known that God resides in his heart, his mind
would have been directed to God in thought and meditation. Some persons
must perform selfless work a long time before they can practise
dispassion and direct their minds to the spiritual ideal and at last be
absorbed in God.</p>
<p><strong>Charity and attachment</strong></p>
<p>\"The activities that Vidyasagar is engaged in are good. Charity is very
noble. There is a great deal of difference between daya, compassion, and
maya, attachment. Daya is good, but not maya. Maya is love for one\'s
relatives-one\'s wife, children, brother, sister, nephew, father, and
mother. But daya is the same love for all created beings without any
distinction.\"</p>
<p>M: \"Is daya also a bondage?\"</p>
<p><strong>The three gunas</strong></p>
<p>MASTER: \"Yes, it is. But that concept is something far beyond the
ordinary man. Daya springs from sattva. Sattva preserves, rajas creates,
and tamas destroys. But Brahman is beyond the three gunas. It is beyond
Prakriti.</p>
<p>\"None of the three gunas can reach Truth; they are like robbers, who
cannot come to a public place for fear of being arrested. Sattva, rajas,
and tamas are like so many robbers.</p>
<p>\"Listen to a story. Once a man was going through a forest, when three
robbers fell upon him and robbed him of all his possessions. One of the
robbers said, \'What\'s the use of keeping this man alive?\' So saying,
he was about to kill him with his sword, when the second robber
interrupted him, saying: \'Oh, no! What is the use of killing him? Tie
him hand and foot and leave him here.\' The robbers bound his hands and
feet and went away.</p>
<p>After a while the third robber returned and said to the man: \'Ah, I am
sorry. Are you hurt? I will release you</p>
<p>from your bonds.\' After setting the man free, the thief said: \'Come
with me. I will take you to the public</p>
<p>highway.\' After a long time they reached the road. Then the robber
said: \'Follow this road. Over there is your house.\' At this the man
said: \'Sir, you have been very good to me. Come with me to my house \'
\'Oh, no!\' the robber replied. \'I can\'t go there. The police will
know it.\'</p>
<p>This world itself is the forest. The three robbers prowling here are
sattva, rajas, and tamas. It is they that rob a man of the Knowledge of
Truth. Tamas wants to destroy him. Rajas binds him to the world. But
sattva rescues him from the clutches of rajas and tamas. Under the
protection of sattva, man is rescued from anger, passion, and the other
evil effects of tamas. Further, sattva loosens the bonds of the world.
But sattva also is a robber. It cannot give him the ultimate Knowledge
of Truth, though it shows him the road leading to the Supreme Abode of
God. Setting him on the path, sattva tells him: \'Look yonder. There is
your home.\' Even sattva is far away from the Knowledge of Brahman.</p>
<p><strong>Nature of Brahman cannot he described</strong></p>
<p>\"What Brahman is cannot be described. Even he who knows It cannot talk
about It. There is a saying that a boat, once reaching the \'black
waters\' of the ocean, cannot come back.</p>
<p><strong>Parable of the four friends</strong></p>
<p>\"Once four friends, in the course of a walk, saw a place enclosed by a
wall. The wall was very high. They all became eager to know what was
inside. One of them climbed to the top of the wall. What he saw on
looking inside made him speechless with wonder. He only cried,\'Ah!
Ah!\' and dropped in. He could not give any information about what he
saw. The others, too, climbed the wall, uttered the same cry, \'Ah!
Ah!\', and jumped in. Now who could tell what was inside?</p>
<p>\"Sages like Jadabharata and Dattatreya, after realizing Brahman, could
not describe It. A man\'s \'I\' completely disappears when he goes into
samādhi after attaining the Knowledge of Brahman. That is why Ramprasad
sang, addressing his mind:</p>
<p>If you should find the task too hard, Call upon Ramprasad for help.</p>
<p>The mind must completely merge itself in Knowledge. But that is not
enough. \'Ramprasad\', that is, the principle of \'I\', must vanish too.
Then alone does one get the Knowledge of Brahman.\"</p>
<p>A DEVOTEE: \"Sir, is it possible then that Sukadeva did not have the
ultimate Knowledge?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"According to some people, Sukadeva only saw and touched the
Ocean of Brahman; he did not dive into It. That is why he could return
to the world and impart religious instruction. According to others, he
returned to the world of name and form, after attaining the Knowledge of
Brahman, for the purpose of teaching others. He had to recite the
Bhagavata to King Parikshit and had to teach people in various ways;
therefore God did not destroy his \'I\' altogether. God kept in him the
\'ego of Knowledge.\' \"</p>
<p><strong>God and religious organization</strong></p>
<p>DEVOTEE: \"Can one keep up an organization after attaining the Knowledge
of Brahman?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Once I talked to Keshab Sen about the Knowledge of Brahman. He
asked me to explain it further. I said, \'If I proceed further, then you
won\'t be able to preserve your organization and following.\' \'Then
please stop here!\' replied Keshab. (All laugh.) But still I said to
Keshab: \' \"I\" and \"mine\" indicate ignorance. Without ignorance one
cannot have such a feeling as \"I am the doer; these are my wife,
children, possessions, name</p>

<p>Renounce this. \"unripe I\" and keep the \"ripe I\", which will make you
feel that you are the servant of God, His devotee, and that God is the
Doer and you are His instrument.\' \"</p>
<p>DEVOTEE: \"Can the \'ripe I\' form an organization?\"</p>
<p><strong>Two kinds of ego</strong></p>
<p>MASTER: \"I said to Keshab Sen that the \'I\' that says, \'I am a
leader, I have formed this party, I am teaching people\', is the
\'unripe I\'. It is very difficult to preach religion. It is not
possible to do so without receiving the commandment of God. The
permission of God is necessary. Sukadeva had a command from God to
recite the Bhagavata. If, after realizing God, a man gets His command
and becomes a preacher or teacher, then that preaching or teaching does
no harm. His \'I\' is not \'unripe\'; it is \'ripe\'.</p>
<p>\"I asked Keshab to give up this \'unripe I\'. The ego that feels, \'I
am the servant of God and lover of God\' does not injure one. I said to
him: \'You have been constantly talking of your organization and your
followers. But people also go away from your organization.\' Keshab
answered: \'It is true, sir. After staying in it several years, people
go to another organization. What is worse, on deserting me they abuse me
right and left.\' \'Why don\'t you study their nature?\' I said. \'Is
there any good in making anybody and everybody a disciple?\'</p>
<p>\"I said to Keshab further: \'You should accept the Divine Mother, the
Primal Energy. Brahman is not different from Its Śakti. What is Brahman
is also Śakti. As long as a man remains conscious of the body, he is
conscious of duality. It is only when a man tries to describe what he
sees that he finds duality.\' Keshab later on recognized Kāli.</p>
<p>\"One day when Keshab was here with his disciples, I said to him that I
would like to hear him preach. He delivered a lecture in the chandni.
Then we all sat by the bathing-ghat and had a long conversation. I said
to him: \'It is Bhagavan alone who in one form appears as bhakta, and in
another as the Bhagavata. Please repeat \"Bhagavata-Bhakta-Bhagavan\".\'
Keshab and his disciples repeated the words. Then I asked him to</p>
<p>repeat \'Guru-Krishna-Vaishnava\'. Thereupon Keshab said: \'Sir, I
should not go so far now. People will say that I have become an orthodox
Hindu.\'</p>
<p>\"It is extremely difficult to go beyond the three gunas. One cannot
reach that state without having realized God. Man dwells in the realm of
maya. Maya does not permit him to see God. It has made him a victim of
ignorance.</p>
<p><strong>Man\'s inordinate attachment</strong></p>
<p>\"Once Hriday brought a bull-calf here. I saw, one day, that he had tied
it with a rope in the garden, so that it might graze there. I asked him,
\'Hriday, why do you tie the calf there every day?\' \'Uncle,\' he said,
\'I am going to send this calf to our village. When it grows strong I
shall yoke it to the plough.\' As soon as I heard these words I was
stunned to think: \'How inscrutable is the play of the divine maya!
Kamarpukur and Sihore are so far away from Calcutta! This poor calf must
go all that way. Then it will grow, and at length it will be yoked to
the plough. This is indeed the world! This is indeed maya!\' I fell down
unconscious. Only after a long time did I regain consciousness.\"</p>
<p>It was three or four o\'clock in the afternoon. M. found Sri Ramakrishna
seated on the couch in an abstracted mood. After some time he heard him
talking to the Divine Mother. The Master said, \"O Mother, why hast Thou
given him only a particle?\" Remaining silent a few moments, he added:
\"I understand it, Mother. That little bit will be enough for him and
will serve Thy purpose. That little bit will enable him to teach
people.\"</p>
<p>Did the Master thus transmit spiritual powers to his disciples? Did he
thus come to know that his disciples, after him, would go out into the
world as teachers of men?</p>
<p>Rākhāl was in the room. Sri Ramakrishna was still in a state of partial
consciousness when he said to Rākhāl</p>
<ol>
<li>\"You were angry with me, weren\'t you? Do you know why I made you
    angry? There was a reason. Only then would the medicine work. The
    surgeon first brings an abscess to a head. Only then does he apply a
    herb so that it may burst and dry up.\"</li>
</ol>
<p>After a pause he went on: \"Yes, I have found Hazra to be like a piece
of dry wood. Then why does he live here? This has a meaning too. The
play is enlivened by the presence of trouble-makers like Jatila and
Kutila.</p>
<p>(To M.) \"One must accept the forms of God. Do you know the meaning of
the image of Jagaddhatri? She is the Bearer of the Universe. Without her
support and protection the universe would fall from its place and be
destroyed. The Divine Mother, Jagaddhatri, reveals Herself in the heart
of one who can control the mind, which may be compared to an elephant.\"</p>
<p>RĀKHĀL : \"The mind is a mad elephant.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Therefore the lion, the carrier of the Divine Mother, keeps it
under control.\"</p>
<p>It was dusk. The evening service began in the temples. Sri Ramakrishna
was chanting the names of the gods and goddesses. He was seated on the
small couch, with folded hands, and became absorbed in contemplation of
the Divine Mother. The world outside was flooded with moonlight, and the
devotees inside the Master\'s room sat in silence and looked at his
serene face.</p>
<p>In the mean time Govinda of Belgharia and some of his friends had
entered the room. Sri Ramakrishna was still in a semi-conscious state.
After a few minutes he said to the devotees: \"Tell me your doubts. I
shall explain everything.\"</p>
<p>Govinda and the other devotees looked thoughtful.</p>
<p><strong>Black complexion of the Divine Mother</strong></p>
<p>GOVINDA: \"Revered sir, why does the Divine Mother have a black
complexion?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"You see Her as black because you are far away from Her. Go
near and you will find Her devoid of all colour. The water of a lake
appears black from a distance. Go near and take the water in your hand,
and you will see that it has no colour at all. Similarly, the sky looks
blue from a distance. But look at the atmosphere near you; it has no
colour. The nearer you come to God, the more you will realize that He
has neither name nor form. If you move away from the Divine Mother, you
will find Her blue, like the grass-flower. Is Syama male or female? A
man once saw the image of the Divine Mother wearing a sacred thread. He
said to the worshipper: \'What? You have put the sacred thread on the
Mother\'s neck!\' The worshipper said: \'Brother, I see that you have
truly known the Mother. But I have not yet been able to find out whether
She is male or female; that is why I have put the sacred thread on Her
image.\'</p>
<p>\"That which is Syama is also Brahman. That which has form, again, is
without form. That which has attributes, again, has no attributes.
Brahman is Śakti; Śakti is Brahman. They are not two. These are only two
aspects, male and female, of the same Reality, Existence-Knowledge-Bliss
Absolute.\"</p>
<p>GOVINDA: \"What is the meaning of \'yogamaya\'?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"It signifies the yoga, or union, of Purusha and Prakriti.
Whatever you perceive in the universe is the outcome of this union. Take
the image of Śiva and Kāli. Kāli stands on the bosom of Śiva; Śiva lies
under Her feet like a corpse; Kāli looks at Śiva. All this denotes the
union of Purusha and Prakriti. Purusha is inactive; therefore Śiva lies
on the ground like a corpse. Prakriti performs all Her activities in
conjunction with Purusha. Thus She creates, preserves, and destroys.
That is also the meaning of the conjoined images of Radha and Krishna.
On account of that union, again, the images are slightly inclined toward
each other.</p>
<p>\"To denote this union, Sri Krishna wears a pearl in His nose, Radha a
blue stone in hers. Radha has a fair complexion, bright as the pearl.
Sri Krishna\'s is blue. For this reason Radha wears the blue stone.
Further, Krishna\'s apparel is yellow, and Radha\'s blue.</p>
<p>\"Who is the best devotee of God? It is he who sees, after the
realization of Brahman, that God alone has become all living beings, the
universe, and the twenty-four cosmic principles. One must discriminate
at first, saying \'Not this, not this\', and reach the roof. After that
one realizes that the steps are made of the same materials as the roof,
namely, brick, lime, and brick-dust. The devotee realizes that it is
Brahman alone that has become all these-the living beings, the universe,
and so on.</p>
<p>\"Mere dry reasoning-I spit on it! I have no use for it! (The Master
spits on the ground.)</p>
<p>\"Why should I make myself dry through mere reasoning? May I have
unalloyed love for the Lotus Feet of God as long as the consciousness of
\'I\' and \'you\' remains with me!</p>
<p>(To Govinda) \"Sometimes I say, \'Thou art verily I, and I am verily
Thou.\' Again I feel, \'Thou art Thou.\' Then I do not find any trace of
\'I\'. It is Śakti alone that becomes flesh as God Incarnate. According
to one school of thought, Rāma and Krishna are but two waves in the
Ocean of Absolute Bliss and Consciousness.</p>
<p><strong>Seeing God in everything</strong></p>
<p>\"Chaitanya, Consciousness, is awakened after Advaita-jnāna, the
Knowledge of the non-dual Brahman. Then one perceives that God alone
exists in all beings as Consciousness. After this realization comes
Ānanda, Bliss. Advaita, Chaitanya, and Nityananda.</p>
<p>(to M.) \"Let me ask you not to disbelieve in the forms of God. Have
faith in God\'s forms. Meditate on that form of God which appeals to
your mind.</p>
<p>(To Govinda) \"The fact is that one does not feel the longing to know or
see God as long as one wants to enjoy worldly objects. The child forgets
everything when he plays with his toys. Try to cajole him away from play
with a sweetmeat; you will not succeed. He will eat only a bit of it.
When he relishes neither the sweetmeat nor his play, then he says, \'I
want to go to my mother.\' He doesn\'t care for the sweetmeat any more.
If a</p>
<p>man whom he doesn\'t know and has never seen says to the child, \'Come
along; I shall take you to your mother\', the child follows him. The
child will go with anyone who will carry him to his mother.</p>
<p>The soul becomes restless for God when one is through with the enjoyment
of worldly things. Then a person has only one thought-how to realize
God. He listens to whatever anyone says to him about God.\"</p>
<p>M. (to himself): \"Alas! The soul becomes restless for God only when one
is through with the enjoyment of worldly things.\"</p>
<p>August 18, 1883</p>
<p><strong>Mystery of Divine Incarnation</strong></p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna was at Balarām Bose\'s house in Calcutta. He was
explaining the mystery of Divine Incarnation to the devotees.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"In order to bring people spiritual knowledge, an Incarnation
of God lives in the world in the company of devotees, cherishing an
attitude of love for God. It is like going up and coming down the stairs
after having once reached the roof. In order to reach the roof, other
people should follow the path of devotion, as long as they have not
attained Knowledge and become free of desire. The roof can be reached
only when all desires are done away with. The shopkeeper does not go to
bed before finishing his accounts. He goes to sleep only when his
accounts are finished.</p>
<p>(To M.) \"A man will certainly succeed if he will take the plunge.
Success is sure for such a man.</p>
<p>\"Well, what do you think of the worship conducted by Keshab, Shivanath,
and the other Brahmo leaders?\"</p>
<ol>
<li>\"They are satisfied, as you say, with describing the garden, but
    they seldom speak of seeing the Master of the garden. Describing the
    garden is the beginning and end of their worship.\"</li>
</ol>
<p>MASTER: \"You are right. Our only duty is to seek the Master of the
garden and speak to Him. The only purpose of life is to realize God.\"</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna then went to Adhar\'s house. After dusk he sang and
danced in Adhar\'s drawing-room. M., Rākhāl , and other devotees were
present. After the music he sat down, still in an ecstatic mood. He said
to Rākhāl : \"This religious fervour is not like rain in the rainy
season, which comes in torrents and goes in torrents. It is like an
image of Śiva that has not been set up by human hands but is a natural
one that has sprung up, as it were, from the bowels of the earth. The
other day you left Dakshineswar in a temper. I prayed to the Divine
Mother to forgive you.\"</p>
<p>The Master was still in an abstracted mood and said to Adhar, \"My son,
meditate on the Deity whose name you chanted.\" With these words he
touched Adhar\'s tongue with his finger and wrote something on it. Did
the Master thereby impart spirituality to Adhar?</p>
