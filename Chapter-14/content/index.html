<p>THE MASTER AND M.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>August 19, 1883</p>
</blockquote>
<p>IT WAS SUNDAY, the first day after the full moon. Sri Ramakrishna was
resting after his noon meal. The midday offering had been made in the
temples, and the temple doors were closed.</p>
<p>In the early afternoon the Master sat up on the small couch in his room.
M. prostrated himself before him and sat on the floor. The Master was
talking to him on the philosophy of Vedānta.</p>
<p><strong>Householders and Non-dualism</strong></p>
<p>MASTER (to M.): \"Self-Knowledge is discussed in the Ashtāvakra Samhitā.
The non-dualists say, \'Soham\', that is, \'I am the Supreme Self.\'
This is the view of the sannyasis of the Vedantic school. But this is
not the right attitude for householders, who are conscious of doing
everything themselves. That being so, how can they declare, \'I am That,
the actionless Supreme Self\'? According to the non-dualists the Self is
unattached. Good and bad, virtue and vice, and the other pairs of
opposites, cannot in any way injure the Self, though they undoubtedly
afflict those who have identified themselves with their bodies. Smoke
soils the wall, certainly, but it cannot in any way affect Ākāśa, space.
Following the Vedantists of this class, Krishnakishore used to say, \'I
am Kha\', meaning Ākāśa. Being a great devotee, he could say that with
some justification; but it is not becoming for others to do so.</p>
<p>\"But to feel that one is a free soul is very good. By constantly
repeating, \'I am free, I am free\', a man verily becomes free. On the
other hand, by constantly repeating, \'I am bound, I am bound\', he
certainly becomes bound to worldliness. The fool who says only, \'I am a
sinner, I am a sinner\', verily drowns himself in worldliness. One
should rather say: I have chanted the name of God. How can I be a
sinner? How can I be bound?\'</p>
<p>(To M.) \"You see, I am very much depressed today. Hriday has written me
that he is very ill. Why should I feel dejected about it? Is it because
of maya or daya?\"</p>
<p>M. could not find suitable words for a reply, and remained silent.</p>
<p><strong>Maya and compassion</strong></p>
<p>MASTER: \"Do you know what maya is? It is attachment to
relatives-parents, brother and sister, wife and children, nephew and
niece. Daya means love for all created beings. Now what is this, my
feeling about Hriday? Is it maya or daya? But Hriday did so much for me:
he served me whole-heartedly and nursed me when I was ill. But later he
tormented me also. The torment became so unbearable that once I was
about to commit suicide by jumping into the Ganges from the top of the
embankment. But he did much to serve me. Now my mind will be at rest if
he gets some money. But whom shall I ask for it? Who likes to speak
about such things to our rich visitors?\"</p>
<p>At two or three o\'clock in the afternoon Adhar Sen and Balarām arrived.
After saluting Sri Ramakrishna, they sat on the floor and asked him if
he was well. The Master said, \"Yes, I am well physically, but a little
troubled in mind.\" He did not refer to Hriday and his troubles.</p>
<p><strong>The conversation turned to the Goddess Simhavahini.</strong></p>
<p>MASTER: \"Yes, I visited the Goddess. She is worshipped by one of the
branches of the Mallick family of Calcutta. This branch of the family is
now in straitened circumstances, and the house they live in is
dilapidated. The walls and floor are spotted with moss and
pigeon-droppings, and the cement and plaster are crumbling. But other
branches of the Mallick family are well off. This branch has no signs of
prosperity. (To M.) Well, what does that signify?\"</p>
<p>M. remained silent.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"The thing is that everyone must reap the result of his
past-karma. One must admit the influence of tendencies inherited from
past births and the result of the prarabdha karma. Nevertheless, in that
dilapidated house I saw the face of the Goddess radiating a divine
light. One must believe in the Divine Presence in the image.</p>
<p>\"Once I went to Vishnupur. The raja of that place has several fine
temples. In one of them there is an image of the Divine Mother, called
Mrinmai.1 There are several lakes near the temple, known as the
Lalbandh, Krishnabandh, and so on. In the water of one of the lakes I
could smell the ointments that women use for their hair. How do you
explain that? I didn\'t know at that time that the woman devotees offer
ointments to the Goddess Mrinmayi while visiting Her temple. Near the
lake I went into samādhi, though I had not yet seen the image in the
temple. In that state I saw the divine form from the waist up, rising
from the water.\"</p>
<p>In the mean time other devotees had arrived. Someone referred to the
political revolution and civil war in Kabul. A devotee said that Yakub
Khan, the Amir of Afghanistan, had been deposed. He told the Master that
the Amir was a great devotee of God.</p>
<p><strong>Pleasure and pain are characteristics of physical life</strong></p>
<p>MASTER: \"But you must remember that pleasure and pain are the
characteristics of the embodied state. In Kavi Kankan\'s Chandi it is
written that Kaluvir was sent to prison and a heavy stone placed on his
chest. Yet Kalu was born as a result of a boon from the Divine Mother of
the Universe. Thus pleasure and pain are inevitable when the soul
accepts a body. Again, take the case of Srimanta, who was a great
devotee. Though his mother, Khullana, was very much devoted to the
Divine Mother, there was no end to his troubles. He was almost beheaded.
There is also the instance of the wood-cutter who was a great lover of
the Divine Mother. She appeared before him and showed him much grace and
love; but he had to continue his profession of wood-cutting and earn his
livelihood by that arduous work. Again, while Devaki, Krishna\'s mother,
was in prison, she had a vision of God Himself endowed with four hands,
holding mace, discus, conch-shell, and lotus. But with all that she
couldn\'t get out of prison.\"</p>
<ol>
<li>\"Why speak only of getting out of prison? This body is the source
    of all our troubles. Devaki should have been freed from the body.\"</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Law of karma</strong></p>
<p>MASTER: \"The truth is that one must reap the result of the prarabdha
karma. The body remains as long as the results of past actions do not
completely wear away. Once a blind man bathed in the Ganges and as a
result was freed from his sins. But his blindness remained all the same.
(All laugh.) It was because of his evil deeds in his past birth that he
had to undergo that affliction.\"</p>
<p>M: \"Yes,sir. The arrow that has already left the bow is beyond our
control.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"However much a bhakta may experience physical joy and sorrow,
he always has knowledge and the treasure of divine love. This treasure
never leaves him. Take the Pandava brothers for instance. Though they
suffered so many calamities, they did not lose their God-Consciousness
even once. Where can you find men like them, endowed with so much
knowledge and devotion?\"</p>
<p>Just then Narendra and Colonel Viswanath Upadhyaya entered the room.
Narendra was then twenty-two years old and studying in college. They
saluted the Master and sat down. The Master requested Narendra to sing.
The Tānpura hung on the west wall of the room. The devotees fixed their
eyes on Narendra as he began to tune the drums.</p>
<p>MASTER (to Narendra): \"The drums don\'t sound as well as before.\"</p>
<p>CAPTAIN: \"They are now full. Therefore they are quiet, like a vessel
filled with water. Or they are like a holy man, who remains silent when
his heart is full of God-Consciousness.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"But what about sages like Nārada?\"</p>
<p>CAPTAIN: \"They talked because they were moved by the sufferings of
others.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"You are right. After attaining samādhi, Nārada, Sukadeva, and
others came down a few steps, as it were, to the plane of normal
consciousness and broke their silence out of compassion for the
sufferings of others and to help them.\"</p>
<p>Narendra began to sing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Oh, when will dawn for me that day of blessedness</em></p>
<p><em>When He who is all Good, all Beauty, and all Truth,</em></p>
<p><em>Will light the inmost shrine of my heart?</em></p>
<p><em>When shall I sink at last, ever beholding Him,</em></p>
<p><em>Into that Ocean of Delight? . . .</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>No sooner had the Master heard a few words of the song than he went into
deep samādhi. He sat with folded hands, facing the east. His body was
erect and his mind completely bereft of worldly consciousness. His
breath had almost stopped. With unwinking eyes he sat motionless as a
picture on a canvas. His mind had dived deep into the Ocean of God\'s
Beauty.</p>
<p>Narendra left the room and went to the east verandah, where Hazra was
seated on a blanket, with a rosary in his hand. They fell to talking.
Other devotees arrived. The Master came down from samādhi and looked
around. He could not find Narendra. The Tānpura was lying on the floor.
He noticed that the earnest eyes of the devotees were riveted on him.</p>
<p>MASTER (referring to Narendra): \"He has lighted the fire. Now it
doesn\'t matter whether he stays in the room or goes out.</p>
<p><strong>Joy of God-Consciousness</strong></p>
<p>(To Captain and the other devotees) \"Attribute to yourselves the bliss
of God-Consciousness; then you too will experience ineffable joy. The
bliss of God-Consciousness always exists in you. It is only hidden by
the veiling and projecting power of maya. The less you are attached to
the world, the more you love God.\"</p>
<p>CAPTAIN: \"The farther you proceed toward your home in Calcutta, the
farther you leave Benares behind. Again, the farther you proceed toward
Benares, the farther behind you leave your home.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"As Radha advanced toward Krishna, she could smell more and
more of the sweet fragrance of His body. The nearer you approach to God,
the more you feel His love. As the river approaches the ocean it
increasingly feels the flow of the tides.</p>
<p><strong>Ideals of Jnāni and bhakta</strong></p>
<p>\"The Jnāni experiences God-Consciousness within himself; it is like the
upper Ganges, flowing in only one direction. To him the whole universe
is illusory, like a dream; he is always established in the Reality of
Self. But with the lover of God the case is different. His feeling does
not flow in only one direction. He feels both the ebb-tide and the
flood-tide of divine emotion. He laughs and weeps and dances and sings
in the ecstasy of God. The lover of God likes to sport with Him. In the
Ocean of God-Consciousness he sometimes swims, sometimes goes down, and
sometimes rises to the surface-like pieces of ice in the water.
(Laughter.)</p>
<p><strong>Brahman and Śakti are not different</strong></p>
<p>\"The Jnāni seeks to realize Brahman. But the ideal of the bhakta is the
Personal God-a God endowed with omnipotence and with the six treasures.
Yet Brahman and Śakti are, in fact, not different. That which is the
Blissful Mother is, again, Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute. They are
like the gem and its lustre. When one speaks of the lustre of the gem,
one thinks of the gem; and again, when one speaks of the gem, one refers
to its lustre. One cannot conceive of the lustre of the gem without
thinking of the gem, and one cannot conceive of the gem without thinking
of its lustre.</p>
<p>\"Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute is one, and one only. But It is
associated with different limiting adjuncts on account of the different
degrees of Its manifestation. That is why one finds various forms of
God. The devotee sings, \'O my Divine Mother, Thou art all these!\'
Wherever you see actions, like creation, preservation, and dissolution,
there is the manifestation of Śakti. Water is water whether it is calm
or full of waves and bubbles. The Absolute alone is the Primordial
Energy, which creates, preserves, and destroys. Thus it is the same
\'Captain\', whether he remains inactive or performs his worship or pays
a visit to the Governor General. Only we designate him by different
names at different times.\"</p>
<p>CAPTAIN: \"Yes, sir, that is so.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"I said those words to Keshab Sen.\"</p>
<p>CAPTAIN: \"Keshab is not an orthodox Hindu. He adopts manners and
customs according to his own whim. He is a well-to-do gentleman and not
a holy man.\"</p>
<p>MASTER (to the other devotees): \"Captain forbids me to go to see
Keshab.\"</p>
<p>CAPTAIN: \"But, sir, you act as you will. What can I do?\"</p>
<p>MASTER (sharply): \"Why shouldn\'t I go to see Keshab? You feel at ease
when you go to the Governor General\'s house, and for money at that.
Keshab thinks of God and chants His name. Isn\'t it you who are always
saying that God Himself has become the universe and all its living
beings? Doesn\'t God dwell in Keshab also?\"</p>
<p>With these words the Master left the room abruptly and went to the
northeast verandah. Captain and the other devotees remained, waiting for
his return. M. accompanied the Master to the verandah, where Narendra
was talking with Hazra. Sri Ramakrishna knew that Hazra always indulged
in dry philosophical discussions. Hazra would say: \"The world is
unreal, like a dream. Worship, food offerings to the Deity, and so
forth, are only hallucinations of the mind. The aim of spiritual life is
to meditate on one\'s own real Self.\" Then he would repeat, \"I am
He.\" But, with all that, he had a soft corner in his heart for money,
material things, and people\'s attention.</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna smiled and said to Hazra and Narendra, \"Hello! What are
you talking about?\"</p>
<p>NARENDRA (smiling): \"Oh, we are discussing a great many things. They
are rather too deep for others.\"</p>
<p>MASTER (with a smile): \"But Pure Knowledge and Pure Love are one and
the same thing. Both lead the aspirants to the same goal. The path of
love is much the easier.\"</p>
<p>Narendra quoted a song:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>O Mother, make me mad with Thy love!</em></p>
<p><em>What need have I of knowledge or reason?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Narendra said to M. that he had been reading a book by Hamilton, who
wrote: \"A learned ignorance is the end</p>
<p>of philosophy and the beginning of religion.\"</p>
<p>MASTER (to M.): \"What does that mean?\"</p>
<p>Narendra explained the sentence in Bengali. The Master beamed with joy
and said in English, \"Thank you! Thank you!\" Everyone laughed at the
charming way he said these words. They knew that his English vocabulary
consisted of only half a dozen words.</p>
<p>It was almost dusk when most of the devotees, including Narendra, took
leave of the Master. Sri Ramakrishna went out and looked at the Ganges
for a few minutes from the west porch. Two priests were bathing in
preparation for the evening worship. Young men of the village were
strolling in the garden or standing on the concrete embankment, gazing
at the murmuring river. Others, perhaps more thoughtful, were walking
about in the solitude of the Panchavati.</p>
<p>It became dark. The maidservant lighted the lamp in Sri Ramakrishna\'s
room and burnt incense. The evening worship began in the twelve temples
of Śiva and in the shrines of Krishna and Kāli.</p>
<p>As it was the first day after the full moon, the moonlight soon flooded
the tops of the trees and temples, and touched with silver the
numberless waves of the sacred river.</p>
<p>The Master returned to his room. After bowing to the Divine Mother, he
clapped his hands and chanted the sweet names of God. A number of holy
pictures hung on the walls of the room. Among others, there were
pictures of Dhruva, Prahlada, Kāli, Radha-Krishna, and the coronation of
Rāma. The Master bowed low before the pictures and repeated the holy
names. Then he repeated the holy words, \"Brahma-Ātmā-Bhagavan;
Bhagavata-Bhakta-Bhagavan; Brahma-Śakti, Śakti-Brahma; Veda, Purana,
Tantra, Gitā, Gayatri.\" Then he said: \"I have taken refuge at Thy
feet, O Divine Mother; not I, but Thou. I am the machine and Thou art
the Operator\", and so on.</p>
<p><strong>Master extols Narendra</strong></p>
<p>While the Master was meditating in this fashion on the Divine Mother, a
few devotees, coming in from the garden, gathered in his room. Sri
Ramakrishna sat down on the small couch. He said to the devotees:
\"Narendra, Bhavanath, Rākhāl , and devotees like them belong to the
group of the nityasiddhas; they are eternally free. Religious practice
on their part is superfluous. Look at Narendra. He doesn\'t care about
anyone. One day he was going with me in Captain\'s carriage. Captain
wanted him to take a good seat, but Narendra didn\'t even look at him.
He is independent even of me. He doesn\'t tell me all he knows, lest I
should praise his scholarship before others. He is free from ignorance
and delusion. He has no bonds. He is a great soul. He has many good
qualities. He is expert in music, both as a singer and player, and is
also a versatile scholar. Again, he keeps his passions under control and
says that he will never marry. There is a close friendship between
Narendra and Bhavanath; they are just like man and woman. Narendra
doesn\'t come here very often. That is good, for I am overwhelmed by his
presence.\"</p>
<p><strong>Monday, August 20, 1883</strong></p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna was sitting on his bed, inside the mosquito net,
meditating. It was about eight o\'clock in the evening. M. was sitting
on the floor with his friend Hari Babu. Hari, a young man of
twenty-eight, had lost his wife about eleven years before and had not
married a second time. He was much, devoted to his parents, brothers,
and sisters.</p>
<p>Hazra was living at Dakshineswar. Rākhāl lived with the Master, though
now and then he stayed at Adhar\'s house. Narendra, Bhavanath, Adhar,
M., Ram, Manomohan, and other devotees visited the Master almost every
week.</p>
<p>Hriday, Sri Ramakrishna\'s nephew, was ill in his home in the country.
The Master was worried about him.</p>
<p>One of the devotees had sent him a little money, but the Master did not
know it.</p>
<p>When Sri Ramakrishna came out of the mosquito net and sat on the small
couch, the devotees saluted him.</p>
<p>MASTER (to M.): \"I was meditating inside the net. It occurred to me
that meditation, after all, was nothing but the imagining of a form, and
so I did not enjoy it. One gets satisfaction if God reveals Himself in a
flash. Again, I said to myself, \'Who is it that meditates, and on whom
does he meditate?\' \"</p>
<ol>
<li>\"Yes, sir. You said that God Himself has become everything-the
    universe and all living beings. Even he who meditates is God.\"</li>
</ol>
<p>MASTER: \"What is more, one cannot meditate unless God wills it. One can
meditate when God makes it possible for one to do so. What do you say?\"</p>
<p>M: \"True, sir. You feel like that because there is no \'I\' in you.
When there is no ego, one feels like that.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"But it is good .to have a trace of ego, which makes it
possible for a man to feel that he is the servant of God. As long as a
man thinks that it is he who is doing his duties, it is very good for
him to feel that God is the Master and he God\'s servant. When one is
conscious of doing work, one should establish with God the relationship
of servant and Master.\"</p>
<p>M. was always reflecting on the nature of the Supreme Brahman.</p>
<p><strong>Nature of Brahman</strong></p>
<p>MASTER (to M.): \"Like the Ākāśa, Brahman is without any modification.
It has become manifold because of Śakti. Again, Brahman is like fire,
which itself has no colour. The fire appears white if you throw a white
substance into it, red if you throw a red, black if you throw a black.
The three gunas-sattva, rajas, and tamas-belong to Śakti alone. Brahman
Itself is beyond the three gunas. What Brahman is cannot be described.
It is beyond words. That which remains after everything is eliminated by
the Vedantic process of \'Not this, not this\', and which is of the
nature of Bliss, is Brahman.</p>
<p>\"Suppose the husband of a young girl has come to his father-in-law\'s
house and is seated in the drawing-room with other young men of his age.
The girl and her friends are looking at them through the window. Her
friends do not know her husband and ask her, pointing to one young man,
\'Is that your husband?\' \'No\', she answers, smiling. They point to
another young man and ask if he is her husband. Again she answers no.
They repeat the question, referring to a third, and she gives the same
answer. At last they point to her husband and ask, \'Is he the one?\'
She says neither yes nor no, but only smiles and keeps quiet. Her
friends realize that he is her husband.</p>
<p>\"One becomes silent on realizing the true nature of Brahman.</p>
<p>(To M.) \"Well, why do I talk so much?\"</p>
<ol>
<li>\"You talk in order to awaken the spiritual consciousness of the
    devotees. You once said that when an uncooked luchi is dropped into
    boiling ghee it makes a sizzling noise.\"</li>
</ol>
<p>The Master began to talk to M. about Hazra.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Do you know the nature of a good man? He never troubles
others. He doesn\'t harass people. The nature of some people is such
that when they go to a feast they want special seats. A man who has true
devotion to God never makes a false step, never gives others trouble for
nothing.</p>
<p>\"It is not good to live in the company of bad people. A man should stay
away from them and thus protect himself. (To M.) Isn\'t that so?\"</p>
<ol>
<li>\"Yes, sir. The mind sinks far down in the company of the wicked.
    But it is quite different with a hero, as you say.\"</li>
</ol>
<p>MASTER: \"How is that?\"</p>
<ol>
<li>\"When a fire is feeble it goes out when even a small stick is
    thrown into it; but a blazing fire is not affected even if a
    plantain-tree is thrown into it. The tree itself is burnt to
    ashes.\"</li>
</ol>
<p>The Master asked M. about his friend Hari Babu.</p>
<ol>
<li>\"He has come here to pay you his respects. He lost his wife long
    ago.\" MASTER (to Hari): \"What kind of work do you do?\"</li>
</ol>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
23. \"Nothing in particular. But at home he takes good care of his
    parents and his brothers and sisters.\"</p>
<p>MASTER (with a smile): \"How is that? You are like \'Elder, the
pumpkin-cutter\'. You are neither a man of the world nor a devotee of
God. That is not good. You must have seen the sort of elderly man who
lives in a family and is always ready, day or night, to entertain the
children. He sits in the parlour and smokes the hubble-bubble. With
nothing in particular to do, he leads a lazy life. Now and again he goes
to the inner court and cuts a pumpkin; for, since women do not cut
pumpkins, they send the children to ask him to come and do it. That is
the extent of his usefulness-hence his nickname, \'Elder, the
pumpkin-cutter\'.</p>
<p>\"You must do \'this\' as well as \'that\'. Do your duties in the world,
and also fix your mind on the Lotus Feet of the Lord. Read books of
devotion like the Bhagavata or the life of Chaitanya when you are alone
and have nothing else to do.\"</p>
<p>It was about ten o\'clock. Sri Ramakrishna finished a light supper of
farina pudding and one or two luchis.</p>
<p>After saluting him, M. and his friend took their leave.</p>
<p><strong>Friday, September 7, 1883</strong></p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna and M. were talking in the Master\'s room at half past
seven in the evening. No one else was present.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"The other day I went to Calcutta. As I drove along the streets
in the carriage, I observed that everyone\'s attention was fixed on low
things. Everyone was brooding over his stomach and running after nothing
but food. Everyone\'s mind was turned to \'woman and gold\'. I saw only
one or two with their attention fixed on higher things, with their minds
turned to God.\"</p>
<ol>
<li>\"The present age has aggravated this stomach-worry. Trying to
    imitate the English, people have turned their attention to more
    luxuries; therefore their wants have also increased.\"</li>
</ol>
<p>MASTER: \"What do the English think about God?\"</p>
<ol>
<li>\"They believe in a formless God.\" MASTER: \"That is also one of
      our beliefs.\"</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Master\'s deep spiritual experiences</strong></p>
<p>For a time Master and disciple remained silent. Then Sri Ramakrishna
began to describe his experiences of Brahman.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"One day I had the vision of Consciousness, non-dual and
indivisible. At first it had been revealed to me that there were
innumerable men, animals, and other creatures. Among them there were
aristocrats, the English, the Mussalmans, myself, scavengers, dogs, and
also a bearded Mussalman with an earthenware tray of rice in his hand.
He put a few grains of rice into everybody\'s mouth. I too tasted a
little.</p>
<p>\"Another day I saw rice, vegetables, and other food-stuff, and filth
and dirt as well, lying around. Suddenly the soul came out of my body
and, like a flame, touched everything. It was like a protruding tongue
of fire and tasted everything once, even the excreta. It was revealed to
me that all these are one Substance, the non-dual and indivisible
Consciousness.</p>
<p>\"Another day it was revealed to me that I had devotees-my intimate
companions, my very own. Thereafter I would climb to the roof of the
kuthi as soon as the bells and the conch-shells of the evening service
sounded in the temples, and cry out with a longing heart: \'Oh, where
are you all? Come here! I am dying to see you!\'</p>
<p>(ToM.) \"Well, what do you think of these visions?\"</p>
<ol>
<li>\"God sports through you. This I have realized, that you are the
    instrument and God is the Master. God has created other beings as if
    with a machine, but yourself with His own hands.\"</li>
</ol>
<p>MASTER: \"Well, Hazra says that after the vision of God one acquires the
six divine powers.\"</p>
<p>M: \"Those who seek pure love don\'t want powers.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Perhaps Hazra was a poor man in his previous life, and that is
why he wants so much to see the manifestation of power. He wants to know
what I talk about with the cook. He says to me: \'You don\'t have to
talk to the cook. I shall talk to the manager of the temple myself and
see that you get everything you want.\' (M. laughs aloud.) He talks to
me that way and I say nothing.\"</p>
<ol>
<li>\"Many a time you have said that a devotee, who loves God for the
    sake of love does not care to see God\'s powers. A true devotee
    wants to see God as Gopala. In the beginning God becomes the magnet,
    and the devotee the needle. But in the end the devotee himself
    becomes the magnet, and God the needle; that is to say, God becomes
    small to His devotee.\"</li>
</ol>
<p>MASTER: \"Yes, it is just like the sun at dawn. You can easily look at
that sun. It doesn\'t dazzle the eyes; rather it satisfies them. God
becomes tender for the sake of His devotees. He appears before them,
setting aside His powers.\"</p>
<p>Both remained silent for some time.</p>
<ol>
<li>\"Why should your visions not be real? If they are unreal, then the
    world is still more unreal; for there is only one mind that is the
    instrument of perception. Your pure mind sees those visions, and our
    ordinary minds see worldly objects.\"</li>
</ol>
<p>MASTER: \"I see that you have grasped the idea of unreality. Well, tell
me what you think of Hazra.\"</p>
<p>M: \"Oh, I don\'t know.\" (The Master laughs.)</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Well, do you find me to be like anybody else?\"</p>
<p>M: \"No, sir.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Like any other paramahamsa?\"</p>
<p>M: \"No, sir. You can\'t be compared to anybody else.\"</p>
<p>MASTER (smiling): \"Have you heard of a tree called the \'achina\'?\"</p>
<p>M: \"No, sir.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"There is a tree called by that name. But nobody knows what it
is.\"</p>
<ol>
<li>\"Likewise, it is not possible to recognize you. The more a man
    understands you, the more uplifted he will be.\"</li>
</ol>
<p>M. was silent. He said to himself: \"The Master referred to \'the sun at
dawn\' and \'the tree unrecognizable by man\'. Did he mean an
Incarnation of God? Is this the play of God through man? Is the Master
himself an Incarnation? Was this why he cried to the devotees from the
roof of the kuthi: \'Where are you? Come to me!\'? \"</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna was sitting on the steps of the southeast verandah of
the Kāli temple. Rākhāl , M., and Hazra were with him. He talked
light-heartedly about his boyhood days.</p>
<p>When it was dusk he returned to his room and sat down on the small
couch. Soon he went into samādhi and in that state began to talk to the
Divine Mother. He said: \"Mother, what is all this row about? Shall I go
there? I shall go if You take me.\" The Master was to go to a devotee\'s
house. Was it for this that he was asking the Divine Mother\'s
permission?</p>
<p>Again he spoke to Her, perhaps praying about an intimate disciple:</p>
<p>\"Mother, please make him stainless. Well, Mother, why have You given
him only a particle?\" Remaining silent a moment, he said: \"Oh, I see.
That will be enough for Your work.\"</p>
<p><strong>Nature of the Divine Incarnation</strong></p>
<p>In the same state he said, addressing the devotees: \"That which is
Brahman is verily Śakti. I address That, again, as the Mother. I call It
Brahman when It is inactive, and Śakti when It creates, preserves, and
destroys. It is like water, sometimes still and sometimes covered with
waves. The Incarnation of God is a part of the lila of Śakti. The
purpose of the Divine Incarnation is to teach man ecstatic love for God.
The Incarnation is like the udder of the cow, the only place milk is to
be got. God incarnates Himself as man. There is a great accumulation of
divinity in an Incarnation, like the accumulation of fish in a deep
hollow in a lake.\"</p>
<p>Some of the devotees wondered, \"Is Sri Ramakrishna an Incarnation of
God, like Krishna, Chaitanya, and Christ?\"</p>
<p><strong>Sunday, September 9, 1883</strong></p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna had finished his midday meal and was sitting on the
small couch. Rākhāl , M., and Ratan were sitting on the floor. Ratan was
the steward of Jadu Mallick\'s garden house and was devoted to the
Master. Now and then Ram Chatterji and Hazra passed in or out of the
room. It was about two o\'clock.</p>
<p>Ratan told the Master that a yatra performance by Nilkantha had been
arranged in Jadu Mallick\'s house in Calcutta.</p>
<p>RATAN (to the Master): \"You must go. The date has been set.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"That\'s good, I want to go. Nilkantha sings with great
devotion.\"</p>
<p>A DEVOTEE: \"That is true, sir.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Tears flow from his eyes as he sings. (To Ratan) I am thinking
of spending the night in Calcutta when I go to see the yatra.\"</p>
<p>RATAN: \"That will be fine.\"</p>
<p>Ram Chatterji and the other devotees asked Ratan about a theft in Jadu
Mallick\'s house.</p>
<p>RATAN: \"Yes, the golden sandals of the Deity were stolen from the
shrine room in Jadu Babu\'s house. It has created an uproar. They are
going to try to discover the thief by means of a \'charmed plate\'.
Everybody will sit in one room, and the plate will move in the direction
of the man who stole the sandals.\"</p>
<p>MASTER (with a smile): \"How does the plate move? By itself?\"</p>
<p>RATAN: \"No. A man presses it to the ground.\"</p>
<p>A DEVOTEE: \"It is a kind of sleight of hand. It is a clever trick.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"The real cleverness is the cleverness by which one realizes
God. That trick is the best of all tricks.\"</p>
<p>As the conversation went on, several Bengali gentlemen entered the room
and, after saluting the Master, sat down. One of them was already known
to Sri Ramakrishna. These gentlemen followed the cult of Tantra. The
Master knew that one of them indulged in immoral acts in the name of
religion. The Tantra rituals, under certain conditions, allow the mixing
of men and women devotees. But Sri Ramakrishna regarded all women, even
prostitutes, as manifestations of the Divine Mother. He addressed them
all as \"Mother\".</p>
<p>MASTER (with a smile): \"Where is Achalananda? My ideal is different
from that of Achalananda and his disciples. As for myself, I look on all
women as my mother.\"</p>
<p>The visiting gentlemen sat silent.</p>
<p><strong>Master\'s attitude toward women</strong></p>
<p>MASTER: \"Every woman is a mother to me. Achalananda used to stay here
now and then. He would drink a great deal of consecrated wine. Hearing
about my attitude toward women, he stubbornly justified his own views.
He insisted again and again: \'Why should you not recognize the attitude
of a \"hero\" toward women? Won\'t you admit the injunctions of Śiva?
Śiva Himself is the author of the Tantra, which prescribes various
disciplines, including the \"heroic\".\' I said to him: \'But, my dear
sir, I don\'t know. I don\'t like these ideas. To me every woman is a
mother.\'</p>
<p>\"Achalananda did not support his own children. He said to me, \'God
will support them.\' I said nothing. But this is the way I felt about
it: \'Who will support your children? I hope your renunciation of wife
and children is not a way of earning money. People will think you are a
holy man because you have renounced everything: so they will give you
money. In that way you will earn plenty of money.\'</p>
<p>\"Spiritual practice with a view to winning a lawsuit and earning money,
or to helping others win in court and acquire property, shows a very
mean understanding.</p>
<p><strong>Good use of money</strong></p>
<p>\"Money enables a man to get food and drink, build a house, worship the
Deity, serve devotees and holy men, and help the poor when he happens to
meet them. These are the good uses of money. Money is not meant for
luxuries or creature comforts or for buying a position in society.</p>
<p>\"People practise various Tantrik disciplines to acquire supernatural
powers. How mean such people are! Krishna said to Arjuna, \'Friend, by
acquiring one of the eight siddhis you may add a little to your power,
but you will not be able to realize Me.\' One cannot get rid of maya as
long as one exercises supernatural powers. And maya begets egotism.</p>
<p>\"Body and wealth are impermanent. Why go to so much trouble for their
sakes? Just think of the plight of the hathayogis. Their attention is
fixed on one ideal only-longevity. They do not aim at the realization of
God at all. They practise such exercises as washing out the intestines,
drinking milk through a tube, and the like, with that one aim in view.</p>
<p>\"There was once a goldsmith whose tongue suddenly turned up and stuck
to his palate. He looked like a man in samādhi. He became completely
inert and remained so a long time. People came to worship him. After
several years, his tongue suddenly returned to its natural position, and
he became conscious of things as before. So he went back to his work as
a goldsmith.(All laugh.)</p>
<p>\"These are physical things and have nothing to do with God. There was a
man who knew eighty-two postures and talked big about yoga-samādhi. But
inwardly he was drawn to \'woman and gold\'. Once he found a bank-note
worth several thousand rupees. He could not resist the temptation, and
swallowed it, thinking he would get it out somehow later on. The note
was got out of him all right, but he was sent to jail for three years.
In my guilelessness I used to think that the man had made great
spiritual progress. Really, I say it upon my word!</p>
<p><strong>Master\'s renunciation of money</strong></p>
<p>\"Mahendra Pal of Sinthi once gave Ramlal five rupees. Ramlal told me
about it after he had gone. I asked him what the gift was for, and
Ramlal said that it was meant for me. I thought it might enable me to
payoff some of my debt for milk. That night I went to bed and, if you
will believe me, I suddenly woke up with a pain. I felt as if a cat were
scratching inside my chest. I at once went to Ramlal and asked him:
\'For whom did Mahendra give this money? Was it for your aunt?\'7
\'No,\' said Ramlal, \'it is meant for you.\' I said to him, \'Go and
return the money at once, or I shall have no peace of mind.\' Ramlal
returned the money early in the morning and I felt relieved.</p>
<p>\"Once a rich man came here and said to me: \'Sir, you must do something
so that I may win my lawsuit. I have heard of your reputation and so I
have come here.\' \'My dear sir,\' I said to him, \'you have made a
mistake. I am not the person you are looking for; Achalananda is your
man.\'</p>
<p>\"A true devotee of God does not care for such things as wealth or
health. He thinks: \'Why should I practise spiritual austerities for
creature comforts, money, or name and fame? These are all impermanent.
They last only a day or two.\' \"</p>
<p>The visiting gentlemen took leave of the Master after saluting him. When
they had departed, Sri Ramakrishna smiled and said to M., \"You can
never make a thief listen to religion. (All laugh.)</p>
<p>\"Well, what do you think of Narendra?\"</p>
<p>M: \"He is splendid.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Yes. His intelligence is as great as his learning. Besides, he
is gifted in music, both as a singer and player. Then too, he has
control over his passions. He says he will never marry.\"</p>
<ol>
<li>\"You once said that one who constantly talks of his sin really
    becomes a sinner; he cannot extricate himself from sin. But if a man
    has firm faith that he is the son of God, then he makes rapid
    strides in spiritual life.\"</li>
</ol>
<p>MASTER: \"Yes, faith. What tremendous faith Krishnakishore had! He used
to say: \'I have spoken the name of God once. That is enough. How can I
remain a sinner? I have become pure and stainless.\' One day Haladhāri
said: \'Even Ajamila had to perform austerities to gratify God. Can one
receive the grace of God without austerities? What will one gain by
speaking the name of Narayana only once?\' At these remarks
Krishnakishore\'s anger knew no bounds. The next time he came to this
garden to pick flowers he wouldn\'t even look at Haladhāri.</p>
<p>\"Haladhāri\'s father was a great devotee. At bathing-time he would
stand waist-deep in the water and meditate on God, uttering the sacred
mantra; then the tears would flow from his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>Krishnakishore\'s faith in God</strong></p>
<p>\"One day a holy man came to the bathing-place on the Ganges at
Ariadaha. We talked about seeing him. Haladhāri said, \'What shall we
gain by seeing the body of a man, a mere cage made of the five
elements?\' Krishnakishore heard about it and said: \'What? Did
Haladhāri ask what would be gained by visiting a holy man? By repeating
the name of Krishna or Rāma a man transforms his physical body into a
spiritual body. To such a man everything is the embodiment of Spirit. To
him Krishna is the embodiment of Spirit, and His sacred Abode is the
embodiment of Spirit.\' He also said, \'A man who utters the name of
Krishna or Rāma even once reaps the result of a hundred sandhyas.\'</p>
<p>\"One of his sons chanted the name of Rāma on his death-bed.
Krishnakishore said, \'He has nothing to worry about; he has chanted the
name of Rāma.\' But now and then he wept. After all, it was the death of
his own son.</p>
<p>Nothing whatsoever is achieved by the performance of worship, japa, and
devotions, without faith. Isn\'t that so?\"</p>
<p>M: \"Yes, sir. That is true.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"I see people coming to the Ganges to bathe. They talk their
heads off about everything under the</p>
<p>sun. The widowed aunt says: \'Without me they cannot perform the Durga
Puja. I have to look after even the smallest detail. Again, I have to
supervise everything when there is a marriage festiva1 in the family,
even the bed of the bride and groom.\'\"</p>
<p>M: \"Why should we blame them? How else will they pass the time?\"</p>
<p>MASTER (with a smile): \"Some people have their shrine rooms in their
attics. The women arrange the offerings and flowers and make the
sandal-paste. But, while doing so, they never say a word about God. The
burden of the conversation is: \'What shall we cook today? I couldn\'t
get good vegetables in the market. That curry was delicious yesterday.
That boy is my cousin. Hello there! Have you that job still? Don\'t ask
me how I am. My Hari is no more.\' Just fancy! They talk of such things
in the shrine room at the time of worship!\"</p>
<ol>
<li>\"Yes, sir, it is so in the majority of cases. As you say, can one
    who has passionate yearning for God continue formal worship and
    devotions for long?\"</li>
</ol>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna and M. were now conversing alone.</p>
<p>M: \"Sir, if it is God Himself who has become everything, then why do
people have so many different feelings?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Undoubtedly God exists in all beings as the All-pervading
Spirit, but the manifestations of His Power are different in different
beings. In some places there is a manifestation of the power of
Knowledge; in others, of the power of ignorance. In some places there is
a greater manifestation of power than in others. Don\'t you see that
among human beings there are cheats and gamblers, to say nothing of men
who are like tigers. I think of them as the \'cheat God\', the \'tiger
God\'.\"</p>
<p>M. (with a smile): \"We should salute them from a distance. If we go
near the \'tiger God\' and embrace him, he may devour us.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"He and His Power, Brahman and Its Power-nothing else exists
but this. In a hymn to Rāma, Nārada</p>
<p>said: \'O Rāma, You are Śiva, and Sita is Bhagavati; You are Brahma, and
Sita is Brahmani; You are Indra, and Sita is Indrani; You are Narayana,
and Sita is Lakshmi. O Rāma, You are the symbol of all that is
masculine, and Sita of all that is feminine.\' \"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>M: \"Sir, what is the Spirit-form of God like?\"</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna reflected a moment and said softly: \"Shall I tell you
what it is like? It is like water. . . .</p>
<p>One understands all this through spiritual discipline.</p>
<p>\"Believe in the form of God. It is only after attaining Brahmajnana
that one sees non-duality, the oneness of Brahman and Its Śakti.
Brahman and Śakti are identical, like fire and its power to burn. When
a man thinks of fire, he must also think of its power to burn. Again,
when he thinks of the power to burn, he must also think of fire.
Further, Brahman and Śakti are like milk and its whiteness, water and
its wetness.</p>
<p><strong>Vijnāna or Transcendental Knowledge</strong></p>
<p>\"But there is a stage beyond even Brahmajnana. After jnāna comes
vijnāna. He who is aware of knowledge is also aware of ignorance. The
sage Vasishtha was stricken with grief at the death of his hundred
sons. Asked by Lakshmana why a man of knowledge should grieve for such
a reason, Rāma said, \'Brother, go beyond both knowledge and
ignorance.\' He who has knowledge has ignorance also. If a thorn has
entered your foot, get another thorn and with its help take out the
first; then throwaway the second also.\"</p>
<p>M: \"Should one throwaway both knowledge and ignorance?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Yes. That is why one should acquire vijnāna. You see, he who
is aware of light is also aware of darkness. He who is aware of
happiness is also aware of suffering. He who is aware of virtue is
also aware of vice. He who is aware of good is also aware of evil. He
who is aware of holiness is also aware of unholiness. He who is aware
of \'I\' is also aware of \'you\'.</p>
<p>\"What is vijnāna? It is knowing God in a special way. The awareness
and conviction that fire exists in wood is jnāna, knowledge. But to
cook rice on that fire, eat the rice, and get nourishment from it is
vijnāna. To know by one\'s inner experience that God exists is jnāna.
But to talk to Him, to enjoy Him as Child, as Friend, as Master, as
Beloved, is vijnāna. The realization that God alone has become the
universe and all living beings is vijnāna.</p>
<p>\"According to one school of thought, God cannot be seen. Who sees
whom? Is God outside you, that you can see Him? One sees only oneself.
Having once entered the \'black waters\' of the ocean, the ship does
not come back and so cannot describe what it experiences.\"</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>\"It is true, sir. As you say, having climbed to the top of the
    monument, one becomes unaware of what is below: horses and
    carriages, men and women, houses, shops and offices, and so on.\"</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>MASTER: \"I don\'t go to the Kāli temple nowadays. Is that an offence?
At one time Narendra used to say, \'What? He still goes to the Kāli
temple!\' \"</p>
<p>M: \"Every day you are in a new state of mind. How can you ever offend
God?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Someone said to Sen, about Hriday: \'He is very ill. Please
bring two pieces of cloth and a couple of shirts for him. We will send
them to his village.\' Sen offered only two rupees. How do you explain
that? He has so much money, and yet he is so miserly! What do you say
to that?\"</p>

<li>\"Those who seek God cannot behave that way-I mean those whose goal
    is the attainment of Knowledge.\" MASTER: \"God alone is the Reality

<p><strong>Saturday, September 22, 1883</strong></p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna was seated in the drawing-room of Adhar\'s house in
Calcutta, with Rākhāl , Adhar, M., Ishan, and other devotees. Many
gentlemen of the neighbourhood were also present. It was afternoon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Master was very fond of Ishan. He had been a superintendent in the
Accountant General\'s office, and later on his children also occupied
high government positions. One of them was a class-mate of Narendra.
Ishan\'s purse was always open for the poor and needy. When he retired
from service, he devoted his time to spiritual practices and charity. He
often visited Sri Ramakrishna at Dakshineswar.</p>
<p>MASTER (to Ishan): \"Please tell us the story of the boy who posted the
letter.\"</p>
<p>ISHAN (with a smile): \"A boy once heard that God is our Creator. So he
wrote a letter to God, setting forth his prayers, and posted it. The
address he put on the envelope was \'Heaven\'.\"</p>
<p>MASTER (with a smile): \"Did you hear that story? One succeeds in
spiritual life when one develops a faith like that boy\'s. (To Ishan)
Tell us about the renunciation of activities.\"</p>
<p>ISHAN: \"After the attainment of God, religious duties such as the
sandyha drop away. One day some people were sitting on the bank of the
Ganges performing the sandyha. But one of them abstained from it. On
being asked the reason, he said: \'I am observing asoucha. I cannot
perform the sandyha ceremony.8 In my case the defilement is due to both
a birth and a death. My mother, Ignorance, is dead, and my son,
Self-Knowledge, has been born.\'\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Tell us, also, how caste distinctions drop away when one
attains Self-Knowledge.\"</p>
<p>ISHAN: \"Sankaracharya was once climbing the steps after finishing his
bath in the Ganges, when he saw just in front of him an untouchable who
had a pack of dogs with him. \'You have touched me!\' said Sankara.
\'Revered sir,\' said the pariah, \'I have not touched you, nor have you
touched me. The Self is the Inner Ruler of all beings and cannot be
contaminated. Is there any difference between the sun\'s reflection in
wine and its reflection in the Ganges?\' \"</p>
<p>MASTER (with a smile): \"And about harmony: how one can realize God
through all paths.\"</p>
<p>Ishan (smiling): \"Both Hari and Hara are derived from the same root.
The difference is only in the pratyaya. In reality, He who is Hari is
also Hara. If a man has faith in God, then it doesn\'t matter whom he
worships.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"And please tell us also how the heart of the sādhu is the
greatest of all.\"</p>
<p>ISHAN: \"This earth is the largest thing we see anywhere around us. But
larger than the earth is the ocean, and larger than the ocean is the
sky. But Vishnu, the Godhead, has covered earth, sky, and the nether
world with one of His feet. And that foot of Vishnu is enshrined in the
sādhu\'s heart. Therefore the heart of a holy man is the greatest of
all.\"</p>
<p>The devotees were delighted with Ishan\'s words.</p>
<p>Ishan intended to retire to a solitary place and practise a special
discipline of the Gayatri, through which Brahman is invoked. But the
Master said that the Knowledge of Brahman was not possible without the
complete destruction of worldliness. Further, he said that it was
impossible for a man totally to withdraw his mind from the objects of
the senses in the Kaliyuga, when his life was dependent on food. That is
why the Master discouraged people from attempting the Vedic worship of
Brahman and asked them to worship Śakti, the Divine Mother, who is
identical with Brahman.</p>
<p>MASTER (to Ishan): \"Why do you waste your time simply repeating \'Neti,
neti\'? Nothing whatsoever can be specified about Brahman, except that
It exists.</p>
<p>\"Whatever we see or think about is the manifestation of the glory of
the Primordial Energy, the Primal Consciousness. Creation, preservation,
and destruction, living beings and the universe, and further, meditation
and the meditator, bhakti and prema-all these are manifestations of the
glory of that Power.</p>
<p>\"But Brahman is identical with Its Power. On returning from Ceylon,
Hanuman praised Rāma, saying: \'O Rāma, You are the Supreme Brahman, and
Sita is Your Śakti. You and She are identical\' Brahman and Śakti are
like the snake and. its wriggling motion. Thinking of the snake, one
must think of its wriggling motion, and thinking of its wriggling
motion, one must think of the snake. Or they are like milk and its
whiteness. Thinking of milk, one has to think of its colour, that is,
whiteness, and thinking of the whiteness of milk, one has to think of
milk itself. Or they are like water and its wetness. Thinking of water,
one has to think of its wetness, and thinking of the wetness of water,
one has to think of water.</p>
<p>\"This Primal Power, Mahamaya, has covered Brahman. As soon as the
covering is withdrawn, one realizes: \'I am what I was before\', \'I am
Thou; Thou art I\'.</p>
<p>\"As long as that covering remains, the Vedantic formula \'I am He\',
that is, man is the Supreme Brahman, does not rightly apply. The wave is
part of the water, but the water is not part of the wave. As long as
that covering remains, one should call on God as Mother. Addressing God,
the devotee should say, \'Thou art the Mother and I am Thy child; Thou
art the Master and I am Thy servant.\' It is good to have the attitude
of the servant toward the master. From this relationship of master and
servant spring up other attitudes: the attitude of serene love for God,
the attitude of friend toward friend, and so forth. When the master
loves his servant, he may say to him, \'Come, sit by my side; there is
no difference between you and me.\' But if the servant comes forward of
his own will to sit by the master, will not the master be angry?</p>
<p>\"God\'s play on earth as an Incarnation is the manifestation of the
glory of the ChitŚakti, the Divine Power. That which is Brahman is also
Rāma, Krishna, and Śiva.\"</p>
<p>ISHAN: \"Yes, sir. Both Hari and Hara are derived from the same root.
The difference lies only in the pratyaya.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Yes, there is only One without a second. The Vedas speak of It
as \'Om Satchidananda Brahma\', the Puranas as \'Om Satchidananda
Krishna,\' and the Tantra as \'Om Satchidananda Śiva\'.</p>
<p>\"The ChitŚakti, as Mahamaya, has deluded all with ignorance. It is said
in the Adhyātma Rāmāyana that when the rishis saw Rāma, they prayed to
Him in these words only: \'O Rāma, please do not delude us with Your
world-bewitching maya.\' \"</p>
<p>ISHAN: \"What is this maya?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Whatever you see, think, or hear is maya. In a word, \'woman
and gold\' is the covering of maya.</p>
<p>\"There is no harm in chewing betel-leaf, eating fish, smoking, or
rubbing the body with oil. What will one achieve by renouncing only
these things? The one thing needful is the renunciation of \'woman and
gold\'. That renunciation is the real and supreme renunciation.
Householders should go into solitude now and then, to practise spiritual
discipline in order to cultivate devotion to God; they should renounce
mentally. But the sannyasi should renounce both mentally and physically.</p>
<p>\"I once said to Keshab, \'How can a typhoid patient be cured if he
remains in a room where a pitcher of water and a jar of pickles are
kept?\' Now and then one should live in solitude \".</p>
<p>A DEVOTEE: \"Sir, what do you think of the Navavidhan? It seems to me
like a hotchpotch of everything.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Some say it is a modern thing. That sets me wondering: \'Then
is the God of the Brahmo Samaj a new God?\' The Brahmos speak of their
cult as the Navavidhan, as a New Dispensation. Well, it may be so. Who
knows? There are six systems of philosophy; so perhaps it is like one of
these.</p>
<p>\"But do you know where those who speak of the formless God make their
mistake? It is where they say that God is formless only, and that those
who differ with them are wrong.</p>
<p>\"But I know that God is both with and without form. And He may have
many more aspects. It is possible for Him to be everything.</p>
<p>(To Ishan) \"The ChitŚakti, Mahamaya, has become the twenty-four cosmic
principles. One day as I was meditating, my mind wandered away to
Rashke\'s house. He is a scavenger. I said to my mind, \'Stay there, you
rogue!\' The Divine Mother revealed to me that the men and women in this
house were mere masks; inside them was the same Divine Power, Kundalini,
that rises up through the six spiritual centres of the body.</p>
<p>\"Is the Primal Energy man or woman? Once at Kamarpukur I saw the
worship of Kāli in the house of the Lahas. They put a sacred thread.11
on the image of the Divine Mother. One man asked, \'Why have they put
the sacred thread on the Mother\'s person?\' The master of the house
said: \'Brother, I see that you have rightly understood the Mother. But
I do not yet know whether the Divine Mother is male or female.\'</p>
<p>\"It is said that Mahamaya swallowed Śiva. When the six centres in Her
were awakened, Śiva came out through Her thigh. Then Śiva created the
Tantra philosophy.</p>
<p>\"Take refuge in the ChitŚakti, the Mahamaya.\"</p>
<p>ISHAN: \"Please bestow your grace on me.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Say to God with a guileless heart, \'O God, reveal Thyself to</p>
<p>me.\' And weep. Pray to God, \'O God, keep my mind away from \"woman,
and gold\".\' And dive deep. Can a man get pearls by floating or
swimming on the surface? He must dive deep.</p>
<p><strong>Faith in the guru</strong></p>
<p>\"One must get instruction from a guru. Once a man was looking for a
stone image of Śiva. Someone said to him: \'Go to a certain river. There
you will find a tree. Near it is a whirlpool. Dive into the water there,
and you will find the image of Śiva.\' So I say that one must get
instruction from a teacher.\"</p>
<p>ISHAN: \"That is true, sir.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"It is Satchidananda that comes to us in the form of the guru.
If a man is initiated by a human guru, he will not achieve anything if
he regards his guru as a mere man. The guru should be regarded as the
direct manifestation of God. Only then can the disciple have faith in
the mantra given by the guru. Once a man has faith he, achieves all. The
sudra Ekalavya learnt archery in the forest before a clay image of
Drona; He worshipped the image as the living Drona; that by itself
enabled him to attain mastery in archery.</p>
<p>\"Don\'t mix intimately with brahmin pundits. Their only concern is to
earn money. I have seen brahmin priests reciting the Chandi while
performing the swastyayana. It is hard to tell whether they are reading
the sacred book or something else. They turn half the pages without
reading them. (All laugh.)</p>
<p>\"A nail-knife suffices to kill oneself. One needs sword and shield to
kill others. That is the purpose of the sastras.</p>
<p>\"One doesn\'t really need to study the different scriptures. If one has
no discrimination, one doesn\'t achieve anything through mere
scholarship, even though one studies all the six systems of philosophy.
Call on God, crying to Him secretly in solitude. He will give all that
you need.\"</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna had heard that Ishan was building a house on the bank of
the Ganges for the practice of spiritual discipline. He asked Ishan
eagerly: \"Has the house been built? Let me tell you that the less
people know of your spiritual life, the better it will be for you.
Devotees endowed with sattva meditate in a secluded corner or in a
forest, or withdraw into the mind. Sometimes they meditate inside the
mosquito net.\"</p>
<p>Now and then Ishan invited Hazra to his house. Hazra had a craze for
outward purity. Sri Ramakrishna often</p>
<p>discouraged him in this.</p>
<p>MASTER (to Ishan): \"Let me tell you another thing. Don\'t be
over-fastidious about outward purity. Once a sādhu felt very thirsty. A
water-carrier was carrying water in his skin water-bag, and offered the
water to the holy man. The sādhu asked if the skin was clean. The
carrier said: \'Revered sir; my skin bag is perfectly clean. But inside
your skin are all sorts of filthy things. That is why I can ask you to
drink water from my skin. It won\'t injure you.\' By \'your skin\', the
carrier meant the body, the belly, and so forth.</p>
<p>\"Have faith in the name of God. Then you won\'t need even to go to holy
places.\"</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna sang, intoxicated with divine fervour:</p>
<p>Why should I go to Ganga or Gaya, to Kasi, Kanchi, or Prabhas,</p>
<p>So long as I can breathe my last with Kāli\'s name upon my lips?</p>
<p>Ishan remained silent.</p>
<p>MASTER (to Ishan): \"Tell me if you have any more doubts.\"</p>
<p>ISHAN: \"You said everything when you spoke of faith.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"God can be realized by true faith alone. And the realization
is hastened if you believe everything about God. The cow that picks and
chooses its food gives milk only in dribblets, but if she eats all kinds
of plants, then her milk flows in torrents.</p>
<p>\"Once I heard a story. A man heard the command of God that he should
see his Ideal Deity in a ram. He at once believed it. It is God who
exists in all beings.</p>
<p>\"A guru said to his disciple, \'It is Rāma alone who resides in all
bodies.\' The disciple was a man of great faith. One day a dog snatched
a piece of bread from him and started to run away. He ran after the dog,
with a jar of butter in his hand, and cried again and again: \'O Rāma,
stand still a minute. That bread hasn\'t been buttered.\'</p>
<p>\"What tremendous faith Krishnakishore had! He used to say, \'By
chanting \"Om Krishna, Om Rāma\", one gets the result of a million
sandhyas.\' Once he said to me secretly, \'I don\'t like the sandhya and
other devotions any more; but don\'t tell anyone.\'</p>
<p>\"Sometimes I too feel that way. The Mother reveals to me that She
Herself has become everything. One day I was coming from the pine-grove
toward the Panchavati. A dog followed me. I stood still for a while near
the Panchavati. The thought came to my mind that the Mother might say
something to me through that dog.</p>
<p>\"You were absolutely right when you said that through faith alone one
achieves all.\"</p>
<p>ISHAN: \"But we are householders.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"What if you are? Through His grace even the impossible becomes
possible. Ramprasad sang, \'This world is a mere framework of
illusion.\' Another man composed a song by way of reply:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>This very world is a mansion of mirth;</em></p>
<p><em>Here I can eat, here drink and make merry.</em></p>
<p><em>Janaka\'s might was unsurpassed;</em></p>
<p><em>What did he lack of the world or the Spirit?</em></p>
<p><em>Holding to one as well as the other,</em></p>
<p><em>He drank his milk from a brimming cup!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>\"One should first realize God through spiritual discipline in solitude,
and then live in the world. Only then can one be a King Janaka. What can
you achieve otherwise?</p>
<p>\"Further, take the case of He dances in a state of samādhi.\"</p>
<p>Śiva. He has everything-Kartika, Ganesa, Lakshmi, and Sarasvati. Still,
sometimes divine fervour, chanting the name of Rāma, and sometimes He is
absorbed in</p>
