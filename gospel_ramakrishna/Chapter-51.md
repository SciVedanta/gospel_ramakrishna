THE MASTER\'S LOVE FOR HIS DEVOTEES

> Wednesday, April 21, 1886

**Narendra and M. & Narendra\'s scepticism**

M. AND NARENDRA were strolling in the garden of the house at Cossipore.
Narendra was very much worried, because he had not yet been able to
solve the financial difficulties of his family.

NARENDRA: \"I don\'t care for the job at the Vidyāsāgar School. I have
been thinking of going to Gaya. I have been told that a Zamindār there
needs the services of a manager for his estate. There is no such thing
as God.\"

M. (smiling): \"You may say that now, but later on you will talk
differently. Scepticism is a stage in the path of God-realization. One
must pass through stages like this and go much farther; only thus can
one realize God. That is what the Master says.\"

NARENDRA: \"Has anybody seen God as I see that tree?\"

1.  \"Yes, our Master has seen God that way.\" NARENDRA: \"It may be his
    hallucination.\"

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
1.  \"Whatever a person experiences in a particular state is real for
    him in that state. Suppose you are dreaming that you have gone to a
    garden. As long as the dream lasts, the garden is real for you. But
    you think of it as unreal when your mind undergoes a change, as, for
    instance, when you awake. When your mind attains the state in which
    one sees God, you will know God to be real.\"

NARENDRA: \"I want truth. The other day I had a great argument with Sri
Ramakrishna himself.\"

M. (smiling): \"What happened?\"

NARENDRA: \"He said to me, \'Some people call me God.\' I replied, \'Let
a thousand people call you God, but I shall certainly not call you God
as long as I do not know it to be true.\' He said, \'Whatever many
people say is indeed truth; that is dharma.\' Thereupon I replied, \'Let
others proclaim a thing as truth, but I shall certainly not listen to
them unless I myself realize it as truth.\' \"

M. (smiling): \"Your attitude is like that of Western savants-Copernicus
and Berkeley, for instance. The whole world said it was the sun that
moved, but Copernicus did not listen. Everybody said the external world
was real, but Berkeley paid no heed. Therefore Lewis says, \'Why was
Berkeley not a philosophical Copernicus?\' \"

NARENDRA: \"Can you give me a History of Philosophy?

M: \"By whom? Lewis?\"

NARENDRA: \"No, Uberweg. I must read a German author.\"

1.  \"You just said, \'Has anybody seen God as I see that tree?\'
    Suppose God comes to you as a man and says, \'I am God.\' Will you
    believe it then? You certainly remember the story of Lazarus. After
    his death, Lazarus said to Abraham, \'Let me go back to the earth
    and tell my friends and relatives that hell and the after-life
    exist.\' Abraham replied: \'Do you think they will believe you? They
    will say it is a charlatan who is telling them such things.\' The
    Master says that God cannot be known by reasoning. By faith alone
    one attains everything-knowledge and super-knowledge. By faith alone
    one sees God and becomes intimate with Him.\"

It was about three o\'clock in the afternoon. Sri Ramakrishna was in
bed. Ramlal, who had come from Dakshineswar, was massaging his feet.
Gopal of Sinthi and M. were in the room.

Sri Ramakrishna asked M. to shut the windows and massage his feet. At
the Master\'s request Purna had come to the Cossipore garden in a hired
carriage. M. was to pay the carriage hire. Sri Ramakrishna made a sign
to Gopal, asking whether he had obtained the money from M. Gopal
answered in the affirmative.

**Devotees about the Master**

At nine o\'clock in the evening Surendra, Ram, and the others were about
to return to Calcutta. It was the sultry month of April and Sri
Ramakrishna\'s room became very hot during the day; so Surendra had
brought some straw screens to keep the room cool.

SURENDRA: \"Why, nobody has hung up these straw screens. Nobody here
pays attention to anything.\"

A DEVOTEE (smiling): \"The devotees here are now in the state of
Brahmajnana. They feel, \'I am He.\' The world is unreal to them. When
they come down to a lower plane and regard God as the Master and
themselves as His servants, they will pay attention to the service of
Sri Ramakrishna.\" (All laugh.)

**Thursday, April 22, 1886**

In the evening Rākhāl , Śaśi, and M. were strolling in the garden at
Cossipore.

M: \"The Master is like a child-beyond the three *Gunās*.\"

ŚAŚI AND RĀKHĀL : \"He himself has said that.\"

RĀKHĀL : \"He sits in a tower, as it were, from which he gets all
information and sees everything; but others cannot go there and reach
him.\"

1.  \"He said, \'In such a state of mind one sees God constantly.\' In
    him there is not the slightest trace of worldliness. His mind is
    like dry fuel, which catches fire quickly.\"

ŚAŚI: \"He described the different kinds of intelligence to Charu. The
right intelligence is that through which one attains God; but the
intelligence that enables one to become a deputy magistrate or a lawyer,
or to acquire a house, is a mean intelligence. It is like thin and
watery curd, which merely soaks flattened rice but does not add any
flavour to it. It is not like thick, superior curd. But the intelligence
through which one attains God is like thick curd.\"

M: \"Ah, what wonderful words!\"

**Bliss of Brahman and bliss of the world**

ŚAŚI: \"Kāli said to the Master: \'What\'s the good of having joy? The
Bhils are joyous. Savages are always singing and dancing in a frenzy of
delight.\' \"

RĀKHĀL : \"He \[meaning the Master\] replied to Kāli: \'What do you
mean? Can the Bliss of Brahman be the same as worldly pleasure? Ordinary
men are satisfied with worldly pleasure. One cannot enjoy the Bliss of
Brahman unless one completely rids oneself of attachment to worldly
things. There is the joy of money and sense experience, and there is the
Bliss of God-realization. Can the two ever be the same? The rishis
enjoyed the Bliss of Brahman.\' \"

**Master on Buddha**

M: \"You see, Kāli nowadays meditates on Buddha; that is why he speaks
of a state beyond Bliss.\"

RĀKHĀL : \"Yes, Kāli told the Master about Buddha. Sri Ramakrishna said
to him: \'Buddha is an Incarnation of God. How can you compare him to
anybody else? As he is great, so too is his teaching great.\' Kāli said
to him: \'Everything, indeed, is the manifestation of God\'s Power. Both
worldly pleasure and the Bliss of God are the

manifestation of that Power.\' \"

M: \"What did the Master say to that?\"

RĀKHĀL : \"He said: \'How can that be? Is the power to beget a child the
same as the power through which one realizes God?\'\"

Sri Ramakrishna was sitting in his room on the second floor. Narendra,
Rākhāl , Śaśi, Surendra, M., Bhavanāth, and other devotees were present.
Dr. Mahendra Sarkar and Dr. Rajendra Dutta were also there to examine
him. His condition was growing worse.

**On \"woman and gold\"**

The house-rent was between sixty and sixty-five rupees. Surendra bore
most of the expenses and had rented the house in his name. The other
householder devotees contributed financial help according to their
power. A cook and a maid had been engaged to look after the members of
the house-hold.

MASTER (to Dr. Sarkar and the others): \"The expenses are mounting.\"

DR. SARKAR (pointing to the devotees): \"But they are ready to bear
them. They do not hesitate to spend money. (To Sri Ramakrishna) Now, you
see, gold is necessary.\"

MASTER (to Narendra): \"Why don\'t you answer?\"

Narendra remained silent. Dr. Sarkar resumed the conversation.

DR. SARKAR: \"Gold is necessary, and also woman.\"

RAJENDRA: \"Yes, his \[meaning Sri Ramakrishna\'s\] wife has been
cooking his meals.\"

DR. SARKAR (to the Master): \"Do you see?\"

MASTER (smiling): \"Yes-but very troublesome!\"

DR. SARKAR: \"If there were no troubles, then all would become
paramahamsas.\"

MASTER: \"If a woman touches me I fall ill. That part of my body aches
as if stung by a horned fish.\"

DR. SARKAR: \"I believe that. But how can you get along without woman?\"

MASTER: \"My hand gets all twisted up if I hold money in it; my
breathing stops. But there is no harm in spending money to lead a
spiritual life in the world-if one spends it, for instance, in the
worship of God and the service of holy men and devotees.

\"A man forgets God if he is entangled in the world of māyā through a
woman. It is the Mother of the Universe who has assumed the form of
māyā, the form of woman. One who knows this rightly does not feel like
leading the life of māyā in the world. But he who truly realizes that
all women are manifestations of the Divine Mother may lead a spiritual
life in the world. Without realizing God one cannot truly know what a
woman is.\"

Sri Ramakrishna had, felt a slight improvement as a result of the
homeopathic treatment.

RAJENDRA (to the Master): \"After getting rid of this illness you must
begin to practise medicine as a homeopath. Otherwise, what\'s the use of
this human life?\" (All laugh.)

NARENDRA: \"Nothing like leather!\" (All laugh.)

A few minutes later the physicians took their leave. Sri Ramakrishna and
M. were engaged in conversation. The

Master was telling M. how he felt about woman.

MASTER (to M.): \"They say I cannot get along without \'woman and
gold\'. They don\'t understand the state of my mind.

**Sri Ramakrishna and woman**

\"If I touch a woman my hand becomes numb; it aches. If in a friendly
spirit I approach a woman and begin to talk to her, I feel as if a
barrier had been placed between us. It is impossible for me to cross
that barrier.

\"If a woman enters my room when I am alone, at once I become like a
child and regard her as my mother.\"

As M. listened to these words, he became speechless with wonder at Sri
Ramakrishna\'s exalted state of mind.

Bhavanāth and Narendra were sitting at a distance, talking together.

**Encouraging Bhavanāth**

Bhavanāth had married and was trying to find a job; so he could not
visit Sri Ramakrishna frequently at Cossipore. He had said to M.: \"I
understand that Vidyāsāgar wants to start a new school. I have to earn
my livelihood. Will it be possible for me to secure a job in that
school?\" The Master was much worried about Bhavanāth\'s being entangled
in worldly life. Bhavanāth was twenty-three or twenty four years old.

MASTER (to Narendra): \"Give him a lot of courage.\"

Narendra and Bhavanāth smiled. Sri Ramakrishna said to Bhavanāth, by
signs: \"Be a great hero. Don\'t forget yourself when you see her
weeping behind her veil. Oh, women cry so mucheven when they blow their
noses! (Narendra, Bhavanāth, and M. laugh.)

\"Keep your mind firm on God. He who is a hero lives with a woman but
does not indulge in physical pleasures. Talk to your wife only about
God.\"

A few minutes later Sri Ramakrishna said to Bhavanāth, by a sign, \"Take
your meal here today.\"

BHAVANĀTH: \"Yes, sir. I am quite all right. Don\'t worry about me.\"

Surendra came in and took a seat. The devotees offered garlands of
flowers to the Master every evening. Sri Ramakrishna put these garlands
around his neck. Surendra sat quietly in the room. Sri Ramakrishna was
in a very happy mood and gave him two garlands. Surendra saluted the
Master and put them around his neck.

All sat in silence and looked at Sri Ramakrishna. Surendra saluted the
Master again and stood up. He was about to leave. He asked Bhavanāth to
hang the straw screens over the windows.

**Hirananda**

Hirananda came in with two of his friends. He was a native of Sindh,
about twenty-two hundred miles from Calcutta. After finishing his
college education in Calcutta in 1883, he had returned to Sindh and
taken charge of editing two papers, the Sindh Times and the Sindh
Sudhar. While studying in Calcutta he had often visited Keshab Chandra
Sen and had come to know him intimately. He had met Sri Ramakrishna at
the Kāli temple at Dakshineswar and had spent an occasional night there
with the Master. Hearing of Sri Ramakrishna\'s illness, he now came to
Calcutta from Sindh to see him. The Master himself had been very eager
to see Hirananda.

Sri Ramakrishna pointed to Hirananda and said to M., by signs: \"A very
fine boy. Do you know him?\"

M: \"Yes, sir.\"

MASTER (to Hirananda and M.): \"Please talk a little. I want to hear you
both.\"

When M. remained silent, Sri Ramakrishna asked him: \"Is Narendra here?
Call him.\"

Narendra entered the room and sat near the Master.

MASTER (to Narendra and Hirananda): \"I want to hear you two talk.\"

Hirananda was silent a few moments and then after great hesitation began
the conversation.

**Narendra argues with Hirananda**

HIRANANDA (to Narendra): \"Why does a devotee of God suffer?\" His words
were sweet as nectar. Everyone in the room could feel that his heart was
filled with love.

NARENDRA: \"The plan of the universe is devilish. I could have created a
better world.\"

HIRANANDA: \"Can one feel happiness without misery?\"

NARENDRA: \"I am not making a plan for a universe, but simply giving my
opinion of the present plan.

\"But all these problems are solved if we have faith only in one thing,
and that is Pantheism. All doubts disappear if one believes that
everything is God. God alone is responsible for all that happens.\"

HIRANANDA: \"Very easy to say that.\"

Narendra sang Sankara\'s Six Stanzas on Nirvāna:

> *Om I am neither mind, intelligence, ego, nor chitta,*
>
> *Neither ears nor tongue nor the senses of smell and sight;*
>
> *Nor am I ether, earth, fire, water, or air:*
>
> *I am Pure Knowledge and Bliss: I am Śiva! I am Śiva!*
>
> *I am neither the Prāna nor the five vital breaths,*
>
> *Neither the seven elements of the body nor its five sheaths,*
>
> *Nor hands nor feet nor tongue, nor the organs of sex and voiding:*
>
> *I am Pure Knowledge and Bliss: I am Śiva! I am Śiva!*
>
> *Neither loathing nor liking have I, neither greed nor delusion;*
>
> *No sense have I of ego or pride, neither dharma nor moksha;*
>
> *Neither desire of the mind nor object for its desiring:*
>
> *I am Pure Knowledge and Bliss: I am Śiva! I am Śiva!*
>
> *Neither right nor wrongdoing am I, neither pleasure nor pain,*
>
> *Nor the mantra, the sacred place, the Vedas, the sacrifice;*
>
> *Neither the act of eating, the eater, nor the food:*
>
> *I am Pure Knowledge and Bliss: I am Śiva! I am Śiva!*
>
> *Death or fear I have none, nor any distinction of caste;*
>
> *Neither father nor mother nor even a birth have I;*
>
> *Neither friend nor comrade, neither disciple nor guru:*

*I am Pure Knowledge and Bliss: I am Śiva! I am Śiva!*

1.  *have no form or fancy; the All-pervading am I; Everywhere I exist,
    > yet I am beyond the senses; Neither salvation am I, nor anything
    > that may be known: I am Pure Knowledge and Bliss: I am Śiva! I am
    > Śiva!*

HIRANANDA: \"Good!\"

SRI RAMAKRISHNA (to Hirananda, by a sign): \"Give him an answer.\"

HIRANANDA: \"It is all the same, whether you look at a room from a
corner or look at it from the middle. It is the same God-Consciousness
that one feels, whether one says, \'O God, I am Thy servant\', or, \'I
am He.\' One may enter a room by several doors.\"

**Narendra\'s spirit of renunciation**

All sat in silence. Hirananda said to Narendra, \"Please sing some
more.\"

Narendra sang the Five Stanzas on the Kaupina:

> *Roaming ever in the grove of Vedānta,*
>
> *Ever pleased with his beggar\'s morsel,*
>
> *Ever walking with heart free from sorrow,*
>
> *Blest indeed is the wearer of the loin-cloth.*
>
> *Sitting at the foot of a tree for shelter,*
>
> *Using the palms of his hands for eating,*
>
> *Wrapped in a garment fine or ugly,*
>
> *Blest indeed is the wearer of the loin-cloth.*
>
> *Satisfied fully by the Bliss within him,*
>
> *Curbing wholly the cravings of his senses,*
>
> *Contemplating day and night the Absolute Brahman,*
>
> *Blest indeed is the wearer of the loin-cloth.*

When Sri Ramakrishna heard the line, *\"Contemplating day and night the
Absolute Brahman\",* he said in a very

low voice, \"Ah!\" Then, by a sign, he said to the devotees, \"This is
the characteristic of the yogi.\"

Narendra finished the hymn:

> *Witnessing the changes of mind and body,*
>
> *Naught but the self within him beholding,*
>
> *Thinking not of outer, of inner, or of middle,*
>
> *Blest indeed is the wearer of the loin-cloth.*
>
> *Chanting \"Brahman\", the Word of redemption,*
>
> *Meditating only on \"I am Brahman\",*
>
> *Living on alms and wandering freely,*
>
> *Blest indeed is the wearer of the loin-cloth.*

Again Narendra sang:

> *Meditate on Him, the Perfect, the Embodiment of Bliss; Meditate on
> Him, the Formless, the Root of the Universe, The Hearer behind the
> ear, the Thinker behind the mind, The Speaker behind the tongue,
> Himself beyond all words: He is the Life of life, the Ultimate, the
> Adorable!*

MASTER (to Narendra): \"And that one *\'All that exists art Thou.\'* \"

Narendra sang:

> *I have joined my heart to Thee: all that exists art Thou;*
>
> *Thee only have I found, for Thou art, all that exists.*
>
> *O Lord, Beloved of my heart! Thou art the Home of all;*
>
> *Where indeed is the heart in which Thou dost not dwell?*
>
> *Thou hast entered every heart: all that exists art Thou.*
>
> *Whether sage or fool, whether Hindu or Musslman,*
>
> *Thou makest them as Thou wilt: all that exists art Thou.*
>
> *Thy presence is everywhere, whether in heaven or in Kaaba;*
>
> *Before Thee all must bow, for Thou art all that exists.*
>
> *From earth below to the highest heaven, from heaven to deepest
> earth,*
>
> *I see Thee wherever I look: all that exists art Thou.*
>
> *Pondering, I have understood; I have seen it beyond a doubt;*
>
> *I find not a single thing that may be compared to Thee.*
>
> *To Jafar it has been revealed that Thou art all that exists.*

As the Master listened, to the line, *\"Thou hast entered every
heart\",* he said by a sign: \"God dwells in everybody\'s heart. He is
the Inner Guide.\"

As Narendra sang the line, *\"I see Thee wherever I look: all that
exists art Thou\",* Hirananda said to him: \"Yes, \'All

that exists art Thou.\' Now you say: \'Thou! Thou! Not I, but Thou!\'\"

NARENDRA: Give me a one and I\'ll give you a million. Thou art I; I am
Thou. Nothing exists but I \"

Narendra recited a few verses from the Ashtāvakra Samhitā. The room
again became silent.

MASTER (to Hirananda, pointing to Narendra): \"He seems to be walking
with an unsheathed sword in his hand. (To M., pointing to Hirananda) How
quiet! Like a cobra, quiet before the charmer, with its hood spread.\"

Sri Ramakrishna fell into an inward mood. Hirananda and M. were seated
near him. There was complete silence in the room. The Master\'s body was
being racked with indescribable pain. The devotees could not bear the
sight of this illness; but somehow the Master made them forget his
suffering. He sat there, his face beaming as if there were no trace of
illness in his throat. The devotees had placed flowers and garlands
before him as their loving offerings. He picked up a flower and touched
with it first his head, then his throat, heart, and navel. To the
devotees he seemed a child playing with flowers.

Sri Ramakrishna used to tell the devotees that his divine visions and
moods were accompanied by the rising of a spiritual current inside his
body.

Now he talked to M.

MASTER: \"I don\'t remember when the current went up. Now I am in the
mood of a child. That is why I am playing with the flowers this way.

**Master\'s exalted vision**

Do you know what I see now? I see my body as a frame made of bamboo
strips and covered with a cloth. The frame moves. And it moves because
someone dwells inside it.

\"Again, I see the body to be like a pumpkin with the seeds scooped out.
Inside this body there is no trace of passion or worldly attachment. It
is all very clean inside, and- \"

It became very painful for Sri Ramakrishna to talk further. He felt very
weak. M. quickly guessed what the Master wanted to tell the devotees,
and said, \"And you are seeing God inside yourself.\"

MASTER: \"Both inside and outside. The Indivisible Satchidananda-I see
It both inside and outside. It has merely assumed this sheath \[meaning
his body\] for a support and exists both inside and outside. I clearly
perceive this.\"

M. and Hirananda listened intently to these words about his exalted
state of God-Consciousness. A few moments later Sri Ramakrishna looked
at them and resumed the conversation.

MASTER: \"You all seem to me to be my kinsmen. I do not look on any of
you as a stranger.

\"I see you all as so many sheaths, and the heads are moving.

\"I notice that when my mind is united with God the suffering of the
body is left aside.

\"No I perceive only this: the Indivisible Satchidananda is covered with
skin, and this sore in the throat is on one side of it.\"

The Master again fell silent. A few minutes later he said: \"The
attributes of matter are superimposed on Spirit, and the attributes of
Spirit are superimposed on matter. Therefore when the body is ill a man
says, \'I am ill.\' \"

Hirananda wanted to understand what the Master had just said; so M. told
him, \"Then hot water scalds the hand, people say that the water scalds;
but the truth is that it is the heat that scalds.\"

**Master and Hirananda**

HIRANANDA (to the Master): \"Please tell us why a devotee of God
suffers.\"

MASTER: \"It is the body that suffers.\"

Sri Ramakrishna seemed about to say something more. Hirananda and M.
eagerly awaited his words.

Sri Ramakrishna said, \"Do you understand?\"

M. said to Hirananda, in a whisper: \"The body suffers for the purpose
of teaching men. His life is like a book of reference. In spite of so
much physical suffering, his mind is one hundred percent united with
God.\"

HIRANANDA: \"Yes, it is like Christ\'s crucifixion. But still the
mystery remains-why should he, of all people, suffer like this?\"

M: \"The Master says it is the will of the Divine Mother. This is how
She is sporting through his body.\"

The two devotees were talking in whispers. Sri Ramakrishna asked
Hirananda, by a sign, what

M. was talking about. Since Hirananda could not understand the sign, Sri
Ramakrishna repeated it.

HIRANANDA: \"He says that your illness is for the teaching of men.\"

MASTER: \"But that\'s only his guess.

(To M. and Hirananda) \"My mood is changing. I think that I should not
say to everyone, \'May your spiritual consciousness be awakened.\'
People are so sinful in the Kaliyuga; if I awaken their spiritual
consciousness I shall have to accept the burden of their sins.\"

M. (to Hirananda): \"He will not awaken people\'s spiritual
consciousness except at the right time. When a person is ready, he will
awaken his spiritual consciousness.\"

**Friday, April 23, 1886**

It was Good Friday. Hirananda had taken his midday meal at the Cossipore
garden house. About one o\'clock in the afternoon he was stroking Sri
Ramakrishna\'s feet. M. sat near by. Lātu and one or two other devotees
were going in and out of the room. It was the Master\'s earnest desire
that Hirananda should stay for some time at the Cossipore garden house.

While massaging the Master\'s feet, Hirananda conversed with him. He
spoke in a very sweet voice, as if trying to console a child.

HIRANANDA: \"Why should you worry so much? You can enjoy peace of mind
if you have faith in the physician. You are a child.\"

MASTER (to M.): \"How can I have faith in the doctor? Dr. Sarkar said
that I would not recover.\"

HIRANANDA: \"But why should you worry so much about that? What is to
happen must happen.\"

M. (to Hirananda, aside): \"He is not worrying about himself. The
preservation of his body is for the welfare of the devotees.\"

It was a sultry day and the room became very hot at noontime. The straw
screens had been hung over the windows. Hirananda adjusted them. The
Master looked at him.

MASTER (to Hirananda): \"Please don\'t forget to send the pajamas.\"

Hirananda had told Sri Ramakrishna that he would feel more comfortable
if he wore the pajamas used in Sindh.

Sri Ramakrishna was reminding him of them.

Hirananda had not eaten well. The rice had not been well cooked. The
Master felt very sorry about it and asked him again and again whether he
would have some refreshments. On account of his illness he could hardly
talk; but still he repeated the question. He said to Lātu, \"Did you too
eat that rice?\'

Sri Ramakrishna could hardly keep the cloth on his body. He was almost
always naked, like a child. Hirananda had brought with him one or two of
his Brahmo friends. Therefore every now and then the Master pulled the
cloth to his waist.

MASTER (to Hirananda): \"Will you take me for an uncivilized person if I
don\'t cover my body with my cloth?\"

HIRANANDA: \"What difference does that make with you? You are but a
child.\"

MASTER (pointing to a Brahmo devotee): \"But he feels that way\"

Hirananda was about to take his leave. In a very few days he was going
to start for Sindh.

MASTER (to Hirananda): \"Suppose you don\'t go to Sindh.\"

HIRANANDA (smiling): \"But there is nobody there to do my work. I have
my duties.\"

MASTER: \"How much do you earn?\"

HIRANANDA (smiling): \"My work doesn\'t bring me a large salary.\"

MASTER: \"Still, how much?\"

Hirananda laughed.

MASTER: \"Why don\'t you live here?\"

Hirananda did not reply.

MASTER: \"Suppose you give up the job.\"

Hirananda said nothing. He was ready to take his leave.

MASTER: \"When will you see me again?\"

HlRANANDA: \"I shall leave for Sindh on Monday, the day after tomorrow I
shall see you that morning.\"

Hirananda left.

M. was seated by the Master\'s side.

MASTER (to M.): \"He is a fine young man, isn\'t he?\"

M: \"Yes, sir. He has a very sweet nature.\"

MASTER: \"He said that Sindh is twenty-two hundred miles from Calcutta;
and he has come all that way to see me.\"

1.  \"True, Sir. That would be impossible without real love.\" MASTER:
    \"He wants very much to take me to Sindh.\"

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
1.  \"The journey is very painful. It takes four or five days by
    train.\" MASTER: \"He has three university degrees.\"

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
1.  \"Yes, sir.\"

Sri Ramakrishna was tired. He wanted to take a little rest. He asked M.
to open the shutters of the windows and spread the straw mat over his
bed. M. was fanning him. Sri Ramakrishna became drowsy.

After a short nap Sri Ramakrishna said to M., \"Did I sleep?\"

M: \"A little.\"

Narendra, Sarat, and M. were talking downstairs.

NARENDRA: \"How amazing it is! One learns hardly anything though one
reads books for many years. How can a man realize God by practising
*sādhanā* for two or three days? Is it so easy to realize God? (To
Sarat) You have obtained peace. M., too, has obtained it. But I have no
peace.\"

It was afternoon. Many devotees were sitting in the Master\'s room.
Narendra, Sarat, Śaśi, Lātu, Nityagopal, Girish, Ram, M., and Suresh
were present.

Kedār came in. This was his first visit to the Master for some time.
While staying in Dāccā, in connection with his official duties, he had
heard of Sri Ramakrishna\'s illness. On entering Sri Ramakrishna\'s room
he took the dust of the Master\'s feet on his head and then joyously
gave it to the others. The devotees accepted it with bowed heads. As he
offered it to Sarat, the latter himself took the dust of Sri
Ramakrishna\'s feet. M. smiled. The Master also smiled, looking at M.
The devotees sat without uttering a word. Sri Ramakrishna seemed about
to go into an ecstatic mood. Now and then he breathed heavily as if
trying to suppress his emotion. He said to Kedār, by a sign, \"Argue
with Girish.\"

Girish said to Kedār: \"Sir, I beg your pardon. At first I did not know
who you were. That is why I argued with you. But now it is quite
different.\"

Sri Ramakrishna smiled.

The Master drew Kedār\'s attention to Narendra and said: \"He has
renounced everything. (To the devotees) Kedār once said to Narendra,
\'You may reason and argue now, but in the end you will roll on the
ground,

chanting Hari\'s name.\' (To Narendra) Take the dust of Kedār\'s feet.\"

KEDĀR (to Narendra): \"Take the dust of his \[meaning the Master\'s\]
feet. That will do.\"

Surendra was seated behind the other devotees. The Master looked at him
with a smile and said to Kedār, \"Ah, how sweet his nature is!\" Kedār
understood the Master\'s hint and went toward Surendra.

Surendra was very sensitive. Some of the devotees had been collecting
funds from the householder devotees to meet the expenses of the
Cossipore garden house. Surendra felt piqued at this. He was bearing
most of the expenses himself.

SURENDRA (to Kedār): \"How can I sit near all these holy people? A few
days ago some of them \[referring to Narendra\] put on the ochre robe of
the sannyāsi and went on a pilgrimage to Buddha-Gaya. They wanted to see
bigger sādhus there.\"

Sri Ramakrishna was trying to console Surendra. He said: \"You are
right. They are mere children. They don\'t know what is good.\"

SURENDRA (to Kedār): \"Doesn\'t our gurudeva know our inner feeling? He
does not care for money. It is our inner attitude that pleases him.\"

Sri Ramakrishna with a nod of his head approved Surendra\'s words.

The devotees had brought various food offerings for the Master and
placed them in front of him. Sri Ramakrishna put a grain on his tongue
and gave the plate to Surendra. He asked Surendra to distribute the
Prasad to the devotees. Surendra went downstairs with the offerings.

MASTER (to Kedār): \"You had better go downstairs and explain it all to
Surendra. See that they don\'t get into any hot arguments.\"

M. was fanning Sri Ramakrishna. The Master said to him, \"Won\'t you eat
anything?\" He sent M. downstairs.

**Girish and M.**

It was about dusk. Girish and M. were strolling near the small reservoir
in the garden. \'

GIRISH: \"I understand that you are writing something about the Master.
Is it true?\"

M: \"Who told you that?\"

GIRISH: \"I have heard about it. Will you give it to me?\"

1.  \"No, I won\'t part with it unless I feel it is right to do so. I am
    writing it for myself, not for others.\" GIRISH: \"What do you
    mean?\"

1.  \"You may get it when I die.\"

It was evening. A lamp was lighted in the Master\'s room. Amrita Basu, a
Brahmo devotee, came in. Sri Ramakrishna had expressed his eagerness to
see him. M. and a few other devotees were there. A garland of jasmine
lay in front of the Master on a plantain-leaf. There was perfect silence
in the room. A great yogi seemed to be silently communing with God.
Every now and then the Master lifted the garland a little, as if he
wanted to put it around his neck.

AMRITA (tenderly): \"Shall I put it around your neck?\"

Sri Ramakrishna accepted the garland. He had a long conversation with
Amrita. When the latter was about to

take his leave, the Master said, \"Come again.\"

AMRITA: \"Yes, sir. I like to come very much. But I live at a great
distance; so I cannot always come.\"

MASTER: \"Do come, and take the carriage hire from here.\"

The devotees were amazed at the Master\'s tender love for Amrita.

**Master\'s kindness to M. and his wife**

The next day M. came to the garden house accompanied by his wife and a
son. The boy was seven years old. It was at the Master\'s request that
he brought his wife, who was almost mad with grief owing to the death of
one of her sons.

That day the Master several times allowed M.\'s wife the privilege of
waiting on him. Her welfare seemed to occupy his attention a great deal.
In the evening the Holy Mother came to the Master\'s room to feed him.
M.\'s wife accompanied her with a lamp. The Master tenderly asked her
many questions about her household. He requested her to come again to
the garden house and spend a few days with the Holy Mother, not
forgetting to ask her to bring her baby daughter. When the Master had
finished his meal M.\'s wife removed the plates. He chatted with her a
few minutes.

About nine o\'clock in the evening Sri Ramakrishna was seated in his
room with the devotees. He had a garland of flowers around his neck. He
told M. that he had requested his wife to spend a few days at the garden
house with the Holy Mother. His kindness touched M.\'s heart.

M. was fanning him. The Master took the garland from his neck and said
something to himself. Then in a very benign mood he gave the garland to
M.
