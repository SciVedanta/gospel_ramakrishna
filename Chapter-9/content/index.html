<p>THE MASTER\'S BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION AT DAKSHINESWAR</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sunday, February 18, 1883</p>
</blockquote>
<p>SRI RAMAKRISHNA arrived at Govinda Mukherji\'s house at Belgharia, near
Calcutta. Besides Narendra, Ram, and other devotees, some of Govinda\'s
neighbours were present. The Master first sang and danced with the
devotees. After the kirtan they sat down. Many saluted the Master. Now
and then he would say, \"Bow before God.\"</p>
<p><strong>Master\'s attitude toward the wicked</strong></p>
<p>\"It is God alone\", he said, \"who has become all this. But in certain
places- for instance, in a holy man-there is a greater manifestation
than in others. You may say, there are wicked men also. That is true,
even as there are tigers and lions; but one need not hug the \'tiger
God\'. One should keep away from him and salute him from a distance.
Take water, for instance. Some water may be drunk, some may be used for
worship, some for bathing, and some only for washing dishes.\"</p>
<p><strong>Paths of knowledge and devotion</strong></p>
<p>A NEIGHBOUR: \"Revered sir, what are the doctrines of Vedanta?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"The Vedantist says, \'I am He.\' Brahman is real and the world
illusory. Even the \'I\' is illusory. Only the Supreme Brahman exists.</p>
<p>\"But the \'I\' cannot be got rid of. Therefore it is good to have the
feeling, \'I am the servant of God, His son, His devotee.\'</p>
<p>\"For the Kāli Yuga the path of bhakti is especially good. One can
realize God through bhakti too. As long as one is conscious of the body,
one is also conscious of objects. Form, taste, smell, sound, and
touch-these are the objects. It is extremely difficult to get rid of the
consciousness of objects. And one cannot realize \'I am He\' as long as
one is aware of objects.</p>
<p>\"The sannyasi is very little conscious of worldly objects. But the
householder is always engrossed in them. Therefore it is good for him to
feel, \'I am the servant of God.\'\"</p>
<p><strong>God\'s name destroys sin</strong></p>
<p>NEIGHBOUR: \"Sir, we are sinners. What will happen to us?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"All the sins of the body flyaway if one chants the name of God
and sings His glories. The birds of sin dwell in the tree of the body.
Singing the name of God is like clapping your hands. As, at a clap of
the hands, the birds in the tree flyaway, so do our sins disappear at
the chanting of God\'s name and glories.</p>
<p>\"Again, you find that the water of a reservoir dug in a meadow is
evaporated by the heat of the sun. Likewise, the water of the reservoir
of sin is dried up by the singing of the name and glories of God.</p>
<p>\"You must practise it every day. The other day, at the circus, I saw a
horse running at top speed, with an Englishwoman standing on one foot on
its back. How much she must have practised to acquire that skill!</p>
<p>\"Weep at least once to see God.</p>
<p>\"These, then, are the two means: practice and passionate attachment to
God, that is to say, restlessness of the soul to see Him.\"</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna began his midday meal with the devotees. It was about
one o\'clock. A devotee sang in the</p>
<p>courtyard below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Awake, Mother! Awake! How long Thou hast been asleep</em></p>
<p><em>In the lotus of the Muladhara!</em></p>
<p><em>Fulfil Thy secret function, Mother:</em></p>
<p><em>Rise to the thousand-petalled lotus within the head,</em></p>
<p><em>Where mighty Śiva has His dwelling;</em></p>
<p><em>Swiftly pierce the six lotuses</em></p>
<p><em>And take away my grief, O Essence of Consciousness!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hearing the song, Sri Ramakrishna went into samādhi; his whole body
became still, and his hand remained touching the plate of food. He could
eat no more. After a long time his mind came down partially to the plane
of the sense world, and he said, \"I want to go downstairs.\" A devotee
led him down very carefully. Still in an abstracted mood, he sat near
the singer. The song had ended. The Master said to him very humbly,
\"Sir, I want to hear the chanting of the Mother\'s name again.\"</p>
<p>The musician sang:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Awake, Mother! Awake! How long Thou hast been asleep</em></p>
<p><em>In the lotus of the Muladhara! . . .</em></p>
<p><em>The Master again went into ecstasy.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>February 25, 1883</strong></p>
<p>After his noon meal the Master conversed with the devotees. Ram, Kedār,
Nityagopal, M., and others had arrived from Calcutta. Rakhal, Harish,
Lātu, and Hazra were living with the Master. Mr.Choudhury, who had three
or four university degrees and was a government officer, was also
present. He had recently lost his wife and had visited the Master
several times for peace of mind.</p>
<p>MASTER (to Ram and the other devotees): \"Devotees like Rakhal,
Narendra, and Bhavanath may be called <em>Nityasiddha</em>. Their spiritual
consciousness has been awake since their very birth. They assume human
bodies only to impart spiritual illumination to others.</p>
<p>\"There is another class of devotees, known as K<em>ripasiddha</em>, that is to
say, those on whom the grace of God descends all of a sudden and who at
once attain His vision and Knowledge. Such people may be likened to a
room that has been dark a thousand years, which, when a lamp is brought
into it, becomes light immediately, not little by little.</p>
<p><strong>Mystery of God\'s ways</strong></p>
<p>\"Those who lead a householder\'s life should practise spiritual
discipline; they should pray eagerly to God in solitude. (To Mr.
Choudhury) God cannot be realized through scholarship. Who, indeed, can
understand the things of the Spirit through reason? No, all should
strive for devotion to the Lotus Feet of God.</p>
<p>\"Infinite are the glories of God! How little can you fathom them! Can
you ever find out the meaning of God\'s ways?</p>
<p>\"Bhishma was none other than one of the eight Vasus, but even he shed
tears on his bed of arrows. He said: \'How astonishing! God Himself is
the companion of the Pandava brothers, and still there is no end to
their troubles and sorrows!\' Who can ever understand the ways of God?</p>
<p>\"A man thinks, \'I have practised a little prayer and austerity; so I
have gained a victory over others.\' But victory and defeat lie with
God. I have seen a prostitute dying in the Ganges and retaining
consciousness to the end.\"</p>
<p><strong>God-vision through pure love</strong></p>
<p>MR. CHOUDHURY: \"How can one see God?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Not with these eyes. God gives one divine eyes; and only then
can one behold Him. God gave Arjuna divine eyes so that he might see His
Universal Form.</p>
<p>\"Your philosophy is mere speculation. It only reasons. God cannot be
realized that way.</p>
<p>\"God cannot remain unmoved if you have raga-bhakti, that is, love of
God with passionate attachment to Him. Do you know how fond God is of
His devotees\' love? It is like the cow\'s fondness for fodder mixed
with oil-cake. The cow gobbles it down greedily.</p>
<p>\"Raga-bhakti is pure love of God, a love that seeks God alone and not
any worldly end. Prahlada had it. Suppose you go to a wealthy man every
day, but you seek no favour of him; you simply love to see him. If he
wants to show you favour, you say: \'No, sir. I don\'t need anything. I
came just to see you.\' Such is love of God for its own sake. You simply
love God and don\'t want anything from Him, in return.\"</p>
<p>Saying this, the Master sang:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Though I am never loath to grant salvation,</em></p>
<p><em>I hesitate indeed to grant pure love.</em></p>
<p><em>Whoever wins pure love surpasses all;</em></p>
<p><em>He is adored by men;</em></p>
<p><em>He triumphs over the three worlds. . . .</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He continued, \"The gist of the whole thing is that one must develop
passionate yearning for God and practise discrimination and
renunciation.\"</p>
<p><strong>Guru and Ishta</strong></p>
<p>MR. CHOUDHURY: \"Sir, is it not possible to have the vision of God
without the help of a guru?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Satchidananda Himself is the Guru. At the end of the
<em>Shavasadhana</em>, just when the vision of the Ishta is about to take
place, the guru appears before the aspirant and says to him, \'Behold!
There is your Ishta.\' Saying this, the guru merges in the Ishta. He who
is the guru is also the Ishta. The guru is the thread that leads to God.
Women perform a ritualistic worship known as the \'Ananta-vrata\', the
object of worship being the Infinite. But actually the Deity worshipped
is Vishnu. In Him are the \'infinite\' forms of God.</p>
<p>(To Ram and the other devotees) \"If you asked me which form of God you
should meditate upon, I should say: Fix your attention on that form
which appeals to you most; but know for certain that all forms are the
forms of one God alone.</p>
<p>\"Never harbour malice toward anyone. Śiva, Kāli, and Hari are but
different forms of that One. He is blessed indeed who has known all as
one. Outwardly he appears as Śiva\'s devotee, But in his heart he
worships Kāli, the Blissful Mother, And with his tongue he chants aloud
Lord Hari\'s name.</p>
<p>\"The body does not endure without a trace of lust, anger, and the like.
You should try to reduce them to a minimum.\"</p>
<p>Looking at Kedār, the Master said: \"He is very nice. He accepts both
the Absolute and the Relative. He believes in Brahman, but he also
accepts the gods and Divine Incarnations in human form.\"</p>
<p>In Kedār\'s opinion Sri Ramakrishna was such an Incarnation.</p>
<p>Looking at Nityagopal, the Master said to the devotees, \"He is in a
lofty mood.</p>
<p>(To Nityagopal) \"Don\'t go there too often. You may go once in a while.
She may be a devotee, but she is a woman too. Therefore I warn you.</p>
<p>\"The sannyasi must observe very strict discipline. He must not look
even at the picture of a woman. But this rule doesn\'t apply to
householders. An aspirant should not associate with a woman, even though
she is very much devoted to God. A sannyasi, even though he may have
subdued his passions, should follow this discipline to set an example to
householders.</p>
<p>\"Worldly people learn renunciation by seeing the complete renunciation
of a monk; otherwise they sink more and more. A sannyasi is a world
teacher.\"</p>
<p><strong>Friday, March 9, 1883</strong></p>
<p><strong>Life of worldliness</strong></p>
<p>About nine o\'clock in the morning the Master was seated in his room
with Rakhal, M., and a few other devotees. It was the day of the new
moon. As usual with him on such days, Sri Ramakrishna entered again and
again into communion with the Divine Mother. He said to the devotees:
\"God alone exists, and all else is unreal. The Divine Mother has kept
all deluded by Her maya. Look at men. Most of them are entangled in
worldliness. They suffer so much, but still they have the same
attachment to \'woman and gold\'. The camel eats thorny shrubs, and
blood gushes from its mouth; still it will eat thorns. While suffering
pain at the time of delivery, a woman says, \'Ah! I shall never go to my
husband again.\' But afterwards she forgets.</p>
<p>\"The truth is that no one seeks God. There are people who eat the
prickly leaves of the pineapple and not the fruit.\"</p>
<p>DEVOTEE: \"Sir, why has God put us in the world?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"The world is the field of action. Through action one acquires
knowledge. The guru instructs the disciple to perform certain works and
refrain from others. Again, he advises the pupil to perform action
without desiring the result. The impurity of the mind is destroyed
through the performance of duty. It is like getting rid of a disease by
means of medicine, under the instruction of a competent physician.</p>
<p>\"Why doesn\'t God free us from the world? Ah, He will free us when the
disease is cured. He will liberate us from the world when we are through
with the enjoyment of \'woman and gold\'. Once a man registers his name
in the hospital, he cannot run away. The doctor will not let him go away
unless his illness is completely cured.\"</p>
<p><strong>Master\'s love for Rakhal</strong></p>
<p>During these days Sri Ramakrishna\'s heart overflowed with motherly love
like the love Yaśoda felt for Krishna. So he kept Rakhal with him.
Rakhal felt toward the Master as a child feels toward its mother. He
would sit leaning on the Master\'s lap as a young child leans on its
mother while sucking her breast.</p>
<p>Rakhal was thus seated by the Master when a man entered the room and
said that a high tide was coming in the Ganges. The Master and the
devotees ran to the Panchavati to see it. At the sight of a boat being
tossed by the tide, Sri Ramakrishna exclaimed: \"Look! Look! I hope
nothing happens to it.\"</p>
<p>They all sat in the Panchavati. The Master asked M. to explain the cause
of the tide. M. drew on the ground the figures of the sun, moon, and
earth and tried to explain gravitation, ebb-tide, flood-tide, new moon,
full moon, eclipse, and so forth.</p>
<p>MASTER (to M.): \"Stop it! I can\'t follow you. It makes me dizzy. My
head is aching. Well, how can they know of things so far off?</p>
<p>\"You see, during my childhood I could paint well; but arithmetic would
make my head spin. I couldn\'t learn simple arithmetic.\"</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna returned to his room with the devotees. Looking at a
picture of Yaśoda, on the wall, he said:</p>
<p>\"It is not well done. She looks like a garland-seller.\"</p>
<p><strong>Adhar\'s first visit</strong></p>
<p>The Master enjoyed a nap after his noon meal. Adhar and other devotees
gradually gathered. This was Adhar\'s first visit. He was a deputy
magistrate and about thirty years old.</p>
<p><strong>Much reasoning condemned</strong></p>
<p>ADHAR (to the Master): \"Sir, I have a question to ask. Is it good to
sacrifice animals before the Deity? It certainly involves killing.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"The sastra prescribes sacrifice on special occasions. Such
sacrifice is not harmful. Take, for instance, the sacrifice of a goat on
the eighth day of the full or new moon.</p>
<p>\"I am now in such a state of mind that I cannot watch a sacrifice. Also
I cannot eat meat offered to the Divine Mother. Therefore I first touch
my finger to it, then to my head, lest She should be angry with me.</p>
<p>\"Again, in a certain state of mind I see God in all beings, even in an
ant. At that time, if I see a living being die, I find consolation in
the thought that it is the death of the body, the soul being beyond life
and death.</p>
<p>\"One should not reason too much; it is enough if one loves the Lotus
Feet of the Mother. Too much reasoning throws the mind into confusion.
You get clear water if you drink from the surface of a pool. Put your
hand deeper and stir the water, and it becomes muddy. Therefore pray to
God for devotion.</p>
<p>\"Behind Dhruva\'s devotion there was desire. He practised austerities
to gain his father\'s kingdom. But Prahlada\'s love for God was
motiveless-a love that sought no return.\"</p>
<p>A DEVOTEE: \"How can one realize God?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Through that kind of love. But one must force one\'s demand on
God. One should be able to say:</p>
<p>\'O God, wilt Thou not reveal Thyself to me? I will cut my throat with a
knife.\' This is the tamas of bhakti.\"</p>
<p>DEVOTEE: \"Can one see God?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Yes, surely. One can see both aspects of God-God with form and
without form. One can see God with form, the Embodiment of Spirit.
Again, God can be directly perceived in a man with a tangible form.
Seeing an Incarnation of God is the same as seeing God Himself. God is
born on earth as man in every age.\"</p>
<p><strong>March 11, 1883</strong></p>
<p><strong>Master\'s birthday celebration</strong></p>
<p>It was Sri Ramakrishna\'s birthday. Many of his disciples and devotees
wanted to celebrate the happy occasion at the Dakśineśwar temple garden.</p>
<p>From early morning the devotees streamed in, alone or in parties. After
the morning worship in the temples sweet music was played in the
nahabat. It was springtime. The trees, creepers, and plants were covered
with new leaves and blossoms. The very air seemed laden with joy. And
the hearts of the devotees were glad on this auspicious day.</p>
<p>M. arrived early in the morning and found the Master talking smilingly
to Bhavanath, Rakhal, and Kalikrishna.</p>
<p>M. prostrated himself before him.</p>
<p>MASTER (to M.): \"I am glad you have come.</p>
<p>(To the devotees) \"One cannot be spiritual as long as one has shame,
hatred, or fear. Great will be the joy today. But those fools who will
not sing or dance, mad with God\'s name, will never attain God. How can
one feel any shame or fear when the names of God are sung? Now sing, all
of you.\"</p>
<p>Bhavanath and his friend Kalikrishna sang:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Thrice blessed is this day of joy!</em></p>
<p><em>May all of us unite, O Lord,</em></p>
<p><em>To preach Thy true religion here</em></p>
<p><em>In India\'s holy land!</em></p>
<p><em>Thou dwellest in each human heart;</em></p>
<p><em>Thy name, resounding everywhere,</em></p>
<p><em>Fills the four corners of the sky.</em></p>
<p><em>Today Thy devotees proclaim</em></p>
<p><em>Thy boundless majesty.</em></p>
<p><em>We seek not wealth or friends or fame,</em></p>
<p><em>O Lord! No other hope is ours.</em></p>
<p><em>For Thee alone Thy devotees</em></p>
<p><em>Long with unflagging love.</em></p>
<p><em>Safe at Thy feet, what fear have we</em></p>
<p><em>Of death or danger? We have found</em></p>
<p><em>The Fount of Immortality.</em></p>
<p><em>To Thee the victory, O Lord!</em></p>
<p><em>To Thee the victory!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As Sri Ramakrishna listened to the song with folded hands, his mind
soared to a far-off realm. He remained absorbed in meditation a long
time. After a while Kalikrishna whispered something to Bhavanath. Then
he bowed before the Master and rose. Sri Ramakrishna was surprised. He
asked, \"Where are you going?\"</p>
<p>BHAVANATH: \"He is going away on a little business.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"What is it about?\"</p>
<p>BHAVANATH: \"He is going to the Baranagore Workingmen\'s Institute.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"It\'s his bad luck. A stream of bliss will flow here today. He
could have enjoyed it. But how unlucky!\"</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna did not feel well; so he decided not to bathe in the
Ganges. About nine o\'clock a few jars of water were taken from the
river, and with the help of the devotees he finished his bath on the
verandah east of his room.</p>
<p>After bathing, the Master put on a new wearing-cloth, all the while
chanting the name of God. Accompanied by one or two disciples he walked
across the courtyard to the temple of Kāli, still chanting Her hallowed
name. His eyes had an indrawn look, like that of a bird hatching her
eggs.</p>
<p>On entering the temple, he prostrated himself before the image and
worshipped the Divine Mother. But he did not observe any ritual of
worship. Now he would offer flowers and sandal-paste at the feet of the
image, and now he would put them on his own head. After finishing the
worship in his own way, he asked Bhavanath to carry the green coconut
that had been offered to the Mother. He also visited the images of Radha
and Krishna in the Vishnu temple.</p>
<p>When the Master returned to his room, he found that other devotees had
arrived, among them Ram, Nityagopal, and Kedār. They all saluted the
Master, who greeted them cordially.</p>
<p>He asked Nityagopal, \"Will you eat something now?\" \"Yes\", the
devotee answered. Nityagopal, who was twenty-three or twenty-four years
old and unmarried, was like a child. His mind was always soaring in the
spiritual realm. He visited the Master sometimes alone and sometimes in
Ram\'s company. The Master had observed the spiritual state of his mind
and had become very fond of him. He remarked now and then that
Nityagopal was in the state of a paramahamsa.</p>
<p><strong>Warning to monks</strong></p>
<p>After Nityagopal had finished eating, the Master took him aside and gave
him various instructions.</p>
<p>A certain woman, about thirty-one years old and a great devotee, often
visited Sri Ramakrishna and held him in high respect. She had been much
impressed by Nityagopal\'s spiritual state and, looking upon him as her
own son, often invited him to her house.</p>
<p>MASTER (to Nityagopal): \"Do you go there?\"</p>
<p>NITYAGOPAL (like a child): \"Yes, I do. She takes me\".</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Beware, holy man! Go there once in a great while, but not
frequently; otherwise you will slip from the ideal. Maya is nothing but
\'woman and gold\'. A holy man must live away from woman. All sink
there. \'Even Brahma and Vishnu struggle for life in that whirlpool.\'
\"</p>
<p>Nityagopal listened to these words attentively.</p>
<p>M. (to himself): \"How strange! This young man has developed the state
of a paramahamsa. That is what the Master says now and then. Is there
still a possibility of his falling into danger in spite of his high
spiritual state? What an austere rule is laid down for a sādhu! He may
slip from his ideal by associating intimately with women. How can an
ordinary man expect to attain liberation unless such a high ideal is set
by holy men? The woman in question is very devout; but still there is
danger. Now I understand why Chaitanya punished his disciple, the
younger Haridas, so severely. In spite of his teacher\'s prohibition,
Haridas conversed with a widow devotee. But he was a sannyasi. Therefore
Chaitanya banished him. What a severe punishment! How hard is the rule
for one who has accepted the life of renunciation! Again, what love the
Master cherishes for this devotee! He is warning him even now, lest he
should run into danger in the future.\"</p>
<p>\"Beware, holy man!\" These words of the Master echoed in the hearts of
the devotees, like the distant rumbling of thunder.</p>
<p>The Master went with the devotees to the northeast verandah of his room.
Among them was a householder from the village of Dakśineśwar, who
studied Vedanta philosophy at home. He had been discussing Om with Kedār
before the Master. He said, \"This Eternal Word, the Anāhata Śabda, is
ever present both within and without.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"But the Word is not enough. There must be something indicated
by the Word. Can your name alone make me happy? Complete happiness is
not possible for me unless I see you.\"</p>
<p>DEVOTEE: \"That Eternal Word itself is Brahman.\"</p>
<p>MASTER (to Kedār): \"Oh, don\'t you understand? He upholds the doctrine
of the rishis of olden times. They</p>
<p>once said to Rama: \'O Rama, we know You only as the son of Dasaratha.
Let sages like Bharadvaja worship You as God Incarnate. We want to
realize Brahman, the Indivisible Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute.\'
At these words Rama smiled and went away.\"</p>
<p>KEDĀR: \"Those rishis could not recognize Rama as an Incarnation of God.
They must have been fools,\"</p>
<p>MASTER (seriously): \"Please don\'t say such a thing. People worship God
according to their tastes and</p>
<p>temperaments. The mother cooks the same fish differently for her
children, that each one may have what suits his stomach. For some she
cooks the rich dish of <em>pilau</em>. But not all the children can digest it.
For those</p>
<p>with weak stomachs she prepares soup. Some, again, like fried fish or
pickled fish. It depends on one\'s taste.</p>
<p><strong>Incarnation of God</strong></p>
<p>\"The rishis followed the path of jnāna. Therefore they sought to
realize Brahman, the Indivisible Existence-</p>
<p>Knowledge-Bliss Absolute. But those who follow the path of devotion seek
an Incarnation of God, to enjoy the sweetness of bhakti. The darkness of
the mind disappears when God is realized. In the Purana it is said that
it was as if a hundred suns were shining when Rama entered the court.
Why, then, weren\'t the courtiers burnt up? It was because the
brilliance of Rama was not like that of a material object. As the lotus
blooms when the sun rises, so the lotus of the heart of the people
assembled in the court burst into blossom.\"</p>
<p>As the Master uttered these words, standing before the devotees, he
suddenly fell into an ecstatic mood. His mind was withdrawn from
external objects. No sooner did he say, \"the lotus of the heart burst
into blossom\", than he went into deep samādhi. He stood motionless, his
countenance beaming and his lips parted in a smile.</p>
<p>After a long time he returned to the normal consciousness of the world.
He drew a long breath and repeatedly chanted the name of Rama, every
word showering nectar into the hearts of the devotees. The Master sat
down, the others seating themselves around him.</p>
<p>MASTER (to the devotees): \"Ordinary people do not recognize the advent
of an Incarnation of God. He comes in secret. Only a few of His intimate
disciples can recognize Him. That Rama was both Brahman Absolute and a
perfect Incarnation of God in human form was known only to twelve
rishis. The other sages said to Him, \'Rama, we know You only as
Dasaratha\'s son.\'</p>
<p>\"Can everyone comprehend Brahman, the Indivisible
Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute? He alone has attained perfect love
of God who, having reached the Absolute, keeps himself in the realm of
the Relative in order to enjoy the divine <em>lila</em>. A man can describe the
ways and activities of the Queen if he has previously visited her in
England. Only then will his description of the Queen be correct. Sages
like Bharadvaja adored Rama and said: \'O Rama, You are nothing but the
Indivisible Satchidananda. You have appeared before us as a human being,
but You look like a man because You have shrouded Yourself with Your own
maya.\' These rishis were great devotees of Rama: and had supreme love
for God.\"</p>
<p><strong>Master\'s different spiritual moods</strong></p>
<p>Presently some devotees from Konnagar arrived, singing kirtan to the
accompaniment of drums and cymbals. As they reached the northeast
verandah of Sri Ramakrishna\'s room, the Master joined in the music,
dancing with them intoxicated with divine joy. Now and then he went into
samādhi, standing still as a statue. While he was in one of these states
of divine unconsciousness, the devotees put thick garlands of jasmine
around his neck. The enchanting form of the Master reminded the devotees
of Chaitanya, another Incarnation of God. The Master passed alternately
through three moods of divine consciousness: the inmost, when he
completely lost all knowledge of the outer world; the semi-conscious,
when he danced with the devotees in an ecstasy of love; and the
conscious, when he joined them in loud singing. It was indeed a sight
for the gods, to see the Master standing motionless in samādhi, with
fragrant garlands hanging from his neck, his countenance beaming with
love, and the devotees singing and dancing around him.</p>
<p>When it was time for his noon meal, Sri Ramakrishna put on a new yellow
cloth and sat on the small couch.</p>
<p>His golden complexion, blending with his yellow cloth, enchanted the
eyes of the devotees.</p>
<p>After his meal Sri Ramakrishna rested a little on the small couch.
Inside and outside his room crowded the devotees, among them Kedār,
Suresh, Ram, Manomohan, Girindra, Rakhal, Bhavanath, and M. Rakhal\'s
father was also present.</p>
<p><strong>Efficacy of earnest japa</strong></p>
<p>A Vaishnava goswami was seated in the room. The Master said to him:
\"Well, what do you say? What is the way?\"</p>
<p>GOSWAMI: \"Sir, the chanting of God\'s name is enough. The scriptures
emphasize the sanctity of God\'s name for the Kaliyuga.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Yes, there is no doubt about the sanctity of God\'s name. But
can a mere name achieve anything,</p>
<p>without the yearning love of the devotee behind it? One should feel
great restlessness of soul for the vision of God. Suppose a man repeats
the name of God mechanically, while his mind is absorbed in \'woman and
gold\'. Can he achieve anything? Mere muttering of magic words doesn\'t
cure one of the pain of a spider or scorpion sting. One must also apply
the smoke of burning cow-dung.\"</p>
<p>GOSWAMI: \"But what about Ajamila then? He was a great sinner; there was
no sin he had not indulged in. But he uttered the name of Narayana on
his death-bed, calling his son, who also had that name. And thus he was
liberated.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Perhaps Ajamila had done many spiritual things in his past
births. It is also said that he once practised austerity; besides, those
were the last moments of his life. What is the use of giving an elephant
a bath? It will cover itself with dirt and dust again and become its
former self. But if someone removes the dust from its body and gives it
a bath just before it enters the stable, then the elephant remains
clean. .</p>
<p>\"Suppose a man becomes pure by chanting the holy name of God, but
immediately afterwards commits many sins. He has no strength of mind. He
doesn\'t take a vow not to repeat his sins. A bath in the Ganges
undoubtedly absolves one of all sins; but what does that avail? They say
that the sins perch on the trees along the bank of the Ganges. No sooner
does the man come back from the holy waters than the old sins jump on
his shoulders from the trees. (All laugh.) The same old sins take
possession of him again. He is hardly out of the water before they fall
upon him.</p>
<p>\"Therefore I say, chant the name of God, and with it pray to Him that
you may have love for Him. Pray to God that your attachment to such
transitory things as wealth, name, and creature comforts may become less
and less every day.</p>
<p><strong>Dogmatism condemned</strong></p>
<p>(To the goswami) \"With sincerity and earnestness one can realize God
through all religions. The Vaishnavas will realize God, and so will the
Saktas, the Vedantists, and the Brahmos. The Mussalmans and Christians
will realize Him too. All will certainly realize God if they are earnest
and sincere.</p>
<p>\"Some people indulge in quarrels, saying, \'One cannot attain anything
unless one worships our Krishna\', or, \'Nothing can be gained without
the worship of Kāli, our Divine Mother\', or, \'One cannot be saved
without accepting the Christian religion.\' This is pure dogmatism. The
dogmatist says, \'My religion alone is true, and the religions of others
are false.\' This is a bad attitude. God can be reached by different
paths.</p>
<p>\"Further, some say that God has form and is not formless. Thus they
start quarrelling. A Vaishnava quarrels with a Vedantist.</p>
<p>\"One can rightly speak of God only after one has seen Him. He who has
seen God knows really and truly that God has form and that He is
formless as well. He has many other aspects that cannot be described.</p>
<p><strong>Parable of the elephant and the blind men</strong></p>
<p>\"Once some blind men chanced to come near an animal that someone told
them was an elephant. They were asked what the elephant was like. The
blind men began to feel its body. One of them said the elephant was like
a pillar; he had touched only its leg. Another said it was like a
winnowing-fan; he had touched only its ear. In this way the others,
having touched its tail or belly, gave their different versions of the
elephant. Just so, a man who has seen only one aspect of God limits God
to that alone. It is his conviction that God cannot be anything else.</p>
<p><strong>Illustration of the ocean and the ice</strong></p>
<p>(To the goswami) \"How can you say that the only truth about God is that
He has form? It is undoubtedly true that God comes down to earth in a
human form, as in the case of Krishna. And it is true as well that God
reveals Himself to His devotees in various forms. But it is also true
that God is formless; He is the Indivisible</p>
<p>Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute. He has been described in the Vedas
both as formless and as endowed with form. He is also described there
both as attributeless and as endowed with attributes.</p>
<p>\"Do you know what I mean? Satchidananda is like an infinite ocean.
Intense cold freezes the water into ice, which floats on the ocean in
blocks of various forms. Likewise, through the cooling influence of
bhakti, one sees forms of God in the Ocean of the Absolute. These forms
are meant for the bhaktas, the lovers of God. But when the Sun of
Knowledge rises, the ice melts; it becomes the same water it was before.
Water above and water below, everywhere nothing but water. Therefore a
prayer in the Bhagavata says: \'O Lord, Thou hast form, and Thou art
also formless. Thou walkest before us, O Lord, in the shape of a man;
again, Thou hast been described in the Vedas as beyond words and
thought.\'</p>
<p>\"But you may say that for certain devotees God assumes eternal forms.
There are places in the ocean where the ice doesn\'t melt at all. It
assumes the form of quartz.\"</p>
<p>KEDĀR: \"It is said in the Bhagavata that Vyāsa asked God\'s forgiveness
for his three transgressions. He said: \'O Lord, Thou art formless, but
I have thought of Thee in my meditation as endowed with form; Thou art
beyond speech, but I have sung Thee hymns; Thou art the All-pervading
Spirit, but I have made pilgrimages to sacred places. Be gracious, O
Lord, and forgive these three transgressions of mine.\'\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Yes, God has form and He is formless too. Further, He is
beyond both form and formlessness. No one can limit Him.\"</p>
<p>Rakhal\'s father was sitting in the room. At that time Rakhal was
staying with the Master. After his mother\'s death his father had
married a second time. Now and then he came to Dakśineśwar because of
Rakhal\'s being there. He did not raise much objection to his son\'s
living with the Master. Being a wealthy man of the world, he was always
involved in litigation. There were lawyers and deputy magistrates among
Sri Ramakrishna\'s visitors. Rakhal\'s father found it profitable to
cultivate their acquaintance, since he expected to be benefited by their
counsels in worldly matters.</p>
<p>Now and then the Master cast a glance at Rakhal\'s father. It was his
cherished desire that Rakhal should live with him permanently at
Dakśineśwar.</p>
<p><strong>Rakhal\'s inborn spiritual nature</strong></p>
<p>MASTER (to Rakhal\'s father and the devotees): \"Ah, what a nice
character Rakhal has developed! Look at his face and every now and then
you will notice his lips moving. Inwardly he repeats the name of God,
and so his lips move.</p>
<p><strong>Parable of the Homa bird</strong></p>
<p>\"Youngsters like him belong to the class of the ever-perfect. They are
born with God-Consciousness. No sooner do they grow a little older than
they realize the danger of coming in contact with the world. There is
the parable of the Homa bird in the Vedas. The bird lives high up in the
sky and never descends to earth. It lays its egg in the sky, and the egg
begins to fall. But the bird lives in such a high region that the egg
hatches while falling. The fledgling comes out and continues to fall.
But it is still so high that while falling it grows wings and its eyes
open. Then the young bird perceives that it is dashing down toward the
earth and will be instantly killed. The moment it sees the ground, it
turns and shoots up toward its mother in the sky. Then its one goal is
to reach its mother.</p>
<p>\"Youngsters like Rakhal are like that bird. From their very childhood
they are afraid of the world, and their one thought is how to reach the
Mother, how to realize God.</p>
<p>\"You may ask, \'How is it possible for these boys, born of worldly
parents and living among the worldly-minded, to develop such knowledge
and devotion?\' It can be explained. If a pea falls into a heap of dung,
it germinates into a pea-plant none the less. The peas that grow on that
plant serve many useful purposes. Because it was sown in dung, will it
produce another kind of plant?</p>
<p>\"Ah, what a sweet nature Rakhal has nowadays! And why shouldn\'t it be
so? If the yam is a good one, its shoots also become good. (All laugh.)
Like father like son.\"</p>
<p>M. (aside to Girindra): \"How well he has explained God with and without
form! Do the Vaishnavas believe only in God with form?\"</p>
<p>GIRINDRA: \"Perhaps so. They are one-sided.\"</p>
<ol>
<li>\"Did you understand what he meant by the \'eternal form\' of God?
    That \'quartz\'? I couldn\'t grasp it well.\" MASTER (to M.):
    \"Well, what are you talking about?\"</li>
</ol>
<p>M. and Girindra smiled and remained silent.</p>
<p>Later in the afternoon the devotees were singing in the Panchavati,
where the Master joined them. They sang together in praise of the Divine
Mother:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>High in the heaven of the Mother\'s feet, my mind was soaring like a
kite,</em></p>
<p><em>When came a blast of sin\'s rough wind that drove it swiftly toward
the earth.</em></p>
<p><em>Maya disturbed its even flight by bearing down upon one side,</em></p>
<p><em>And I could make it rise no more.</em></p>
<p><em>Entangled in the twisting string of love for children and for wife,</em></p>
<p><em>Alas! my kite was rent in twain.</em></p>
<p><em>It lost its crest of wisdom soon and downward plunged as I let it
go;</em></p>
<p><em>How could it hope to fly again, when all its top was torn away?</em></p>
<p><em>Though fastened with devotion\'s cord, it came to grief in playing
here;</em></p>
<p><em>Its six opponents worsted it.</em></p>
<p><em>Now Nareschandra rues this game of smiles and tears, and thinks it
better</em></p>
<p><em>Never to have played at all.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The singing continued. Sri Ramakrishna danced with the devotees. They
sang:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The black bee of my mind is drawn in sheer delight</em></p>
<p><em>To the blue lotus flower of Mother Syama\'s feet,</em></p>
<p><em>The blue flower of the feet of Kāli, Śiva\'s Consort;</em></p>
<p><em>Tasteless, to the bee, are the blossoms of desire.</em></p>
<p><em>My Mother\'s feet are black, and black, too, is the bee;</em></p>
<p><em>Black is made one with black! This much of the mystery</em></p>
<p><em>My mortal eyes behold, then hastily retreat.</em></p>
<p><em>But Kamalakanta\'s hopes are answered in the end;</em></p>
<p><em>He swims in the Sea of Bliss, unmoved by joy or pain.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The kirtan went on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>O Mother, what a machine is this that Thou hast made!</em></p>
<p><em>What pranks Thou playest with this toy</em></p>
<p><em>Three and a half cubits high!</em></p>
<p><em>Hiding Thyself within, Thou holdest the guiding string;</em></p>
<p><em>But the machine, not knowing it,</em></p>
<p><em>Still believes it moves by itself.</em></p>
<p><em>Whoever finds the Mother remains a machine no more;</em></p>
<p><em>Yet some machines have even bound</em></p>
<p><em>The Mother Herself with the string of Love.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was a very happy day for all.</p>
<p>The Master, accompanied by M., was coming back to his room, when he met
Trailokya, a Brahmo devotee, on the way. Trailokya bowed before the
Master.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"They are singing in the Panchavati. Won\'t you go there?\"</p>
<p>TRAILOKYA: \"What shall I do there?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Why, you will enjoy the music.\"</p>
<p>TRAILOKYA: \"I have been there already.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Well, well! That\'s good.\"</p>
<p>It was about six o\'clock in the evening. The Master was sitting with
the devotees on the southeast verandah of his room.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"A holy man who has renounced the world will of course chant
the name of God. That is only natural. He has no other duties to
perform. If he meditates on God it shouldn\'t surprise anybody. On the
other hand, if he fails to think of God or chant His holy name, then
people will think ill of him.</p>
<p>\"But it is a great deal to his credit if a householder utters the name
of the Lord. Think of King Janaka. What courage he had, indeed! He
fenced with two swords, the one of Knowledge and the other of work. He
possessed the perfect Knowledge of Brahman and also was devoted to the
duties of the world. An unchaste woman attends to the minutest duties of
the world, but her mind always dwells on her paramour.</p>
<p>\"The constant company of holy men is necessary. The holy man introduces
one to God.\"</p>
<p>KEDĀR: \"Yes, sir. The great soul is born in the world for the
redemption of humanity. He leads others to God, just as a locomotive
engine takes along with it a long train of carriages. Or again, he is
like a river or lake that quenches the thirst of many people.\"</p>
<p>The devotees were ready to return home. One by one they saluted the
Master. At the sight of Bhavanath Sri Ramakrishna said: \"Don\'t go away
today. The very sight of you inspires me.\" Bhavanath had not yet
entered into worldly life. A youth of twenty, he had a fair complexion
and handsome features. He shed tears of joy on hearing the name of God.
The Master looked on him as the embodiment of Narayana.</p>
<p><strong>Thursday, March 29, 1883</strong></p>
<p>The Master had taken a little rest after his noon meal, when a few
devotees arrived from Calcutta, among them Amrita and the well-known
singer of the Brahmo Samaj, Trailokya.</p>
<p>Rakhal was not feeling well. The Master was greatly worried about him
and said to the devotees: \"You see, Rakhal is not well. Will soda-water
help him? What am I to do now? Rakhal, please take the prasad from the
Jagannath temple.\"</p>
<p>Even as he spoke these words the Master underwent a strange
transformation. He looked at Rakhal with the infinite tenderness of a
mother and affectionately uttered the name of Govinda. Did he see in
Rakhal the manifestation of God Himself? The disciple was a young boy of
pure heart who had renounced all attraction to lust and greed. And Sri
Ramakrishna was intoxicated day and night with love of God. At the sight
of Rakhal his eyes expressed the tender feelings of a mother, a love
like that which had filled the heart of Mother Yaśoda at the sight of
the Baby Krishna. The devotees gazed at the Master in wonder as he went
into deep samādhi. As his soul soared into the realm of Divine
Consciousness, his body became motionless, his eyes were fixed on</p>
<p>the tip of his nose, and his breathing almost ceased.</p>
<p><strong>Renunciation, false and true</strong></p>
<p>An unknown Bengali, dressed in the ochre cloth of a monk, entered the
room and sat on the floor. The Master\'s mind was coming down to the
ordinary plane of consciousness. Presently he began to talk, though the
spell of samādhi still lingered.</p>
<p>MASTER (at the sight of the ochre cloth): \"Why this gerrua? Should one
put on such a thing for a mere fancy? A man once said, \'I have
exchanged the Chandi for a drum.\' At first he used to sing the holy
songs of the Chandi; now he beats the drum. (All laugh.)</p>
<p>\"There are three or four varieties of renunciation. Afflicted with
miseries at home, one may put on the ochre cloth of a monk; but that
renunciation doesn\'t last long. Again, a man out of work puts on an
ochre wearing-cloth and goes off to Benares. After three months he
writes home: \'I have a job here. I shall come home in a few days.
Don\'t worry about me.\' Again, a man may have everything he wants. He
lacks nothing, yet he does not enjoy his possessions. He weeps for God
alone. That is real renunciation.</p>
<p>\"No lie of any sort is good. A false garb, even though a holy one, is
not good. If the outer garb does not correspond to the inner thought, it
gradually brings ruin. Uttering false words or doing false deeds, one
gradually loses all fear. Far better is the white cloth of a
householder. Attachment to worldliness, occasional lapses from the
ideal, and an outer garb of gerrua- how dreadful!</p>
<p>\"It is not proper for a righteous person to tell a lie or do something
false even in a dramatic performance. Once I went to Keshab\'s house to
see the performance of a play called <em>Nava-Vrindāvan.</em> They brought</p>
<p>something on the stage which they called the \'Cross\'. Another actor
sprinkled water, which they said was the \'Water of Peace\'. I saw a
third actor staggering and reeling in the role of a drunkard.\"</p>
<p>A BRAHMO DEVOTEE: \"It was K-.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"It is not good for a devotee to play such parts. It is bad for
the mind to dwell on such subjects for a long while. The mind is like
white linen fresh from the laundry; it takes the colour in which you dip
it. If it is associated with falsehood for a long time, it will be
stained with falsehood.</p>
<p>\"Another day I went to Keshab\'s house to see the play called Nimai
Sannyas. Some flattering disciples of Keshab spoiled the whole
performance.</p>
<p>One of them said to Keshab, \'You are the Chaitanya of the Kaliyuga.\'
Keshab pointed to me and asked with a smile, \'Then who is he?\' I
replied: \'Why, I am the servant of your servant. I am a speck of the
dust of your feet.\' Keshab had a desire for name and fame.</p>
<p>(To Amrita and Trailokya) \"Youngsters like Narendra and Rakhal are
ever-perfect. Every time they are born they are devoted to God. An
ordinary man acquires a little devotion after austerities and a hard
struggle. But these boys have love of God from the very moment of their
birth. They are like the natural image of Śiva, which springs forth from
the earth and is not set up by human hands.</p>
<p><strong>Nature of the ever-perfect</strong></p>
<p>\"The ever-perfect form a class by themselves. Not all birds have
crooked beaks. The ever-perfect are never attached to the world. There
is the instance of Prahlada.</p>
<p>\"Ordinary people practise spiritual discipline and cultivate devotion
to God; but they also become attached to the world and are caught in the
glamour of \'woman and gold\'. They are like flies, which sit on a
flower or a sweetmeat and light on filth as well.</p>
<p>\"But the ever-perfect are like bees, which light only on flowers and
sip the honey. The ever-perfect drink only the Nectar of Divine Bliss.
They are never inclined to worldly pleasures.</p>
<p>\"The devotion of the ever-perfect is not like the ordinary devotion
that one acquires as a result of strenuous spiritual discipline.
Ritualistic devotion consists in repeating the name of God and
performing worship in a prescribed manner. It is like crossing a
rice-field in a roundabout way along the balk. Again, it is like
reaching a near-by village by boat in a roundabout way along a winding
river.</p>
<p>\"One does not follow the injunctions of ceremonial worship when one
develops raga-bhakti, when one loves God as one\'s own. Then it is like
crossing a rice-field after the harvest. You don\'t have to walk along
the balk. You can go straight across the field in any direction.</p>
<p>\"When the country is flooded deep with water, one doesn\'t have to
follow the winding river. Then the fields are deep under water. You can
row your boat straight to the village.</p>
<p>\"Without this intense attachment, this passionate love, one cannot
realize God.\"</p>
<p><strong>Master\'s experiences in samādhi</strong></p>
<p>AMRITA: \"Sir, how do you feel in samādhi?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"You may have heard that the cockroach, by intently meditating
on the Bhramara, is transformed into a Bhramara. Do you know how I feel
then? I feel like a fish released from a pot into the water of the
Ganges.\"</p>
<p>AMRITA: \"Don\'t you feel at that time even a trace of ego?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Yes, generally a little of it remains. However hard you may
rub a grain of gold against a grindstone, still a bit of it always
remains. Or again, take the case of a big fire; the ego is like one of
its sparks. In samādhi I lose outer consciousness completely; but God
generally keeps a little trace of ego in me for the enjoyment of divine
communion. Enjoyment is possible only when \'I\' and \'you\' remain.</p>
<p>\"Again, sometimes God effaces even that trace of \'I\'. Then one
experiences jada samādhi or nirvikalpa samādhi. That experience cannot
be described. A salt doll went to measure the depth of the ocean, but
before it had gone far into the water it melted away. It became entirely
one with the water of the ocean. Then who was to come back and tell the
ocean\'s depth?\"</p>
