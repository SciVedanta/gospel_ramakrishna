<p>ADVICE TO HOUSEHOLDERS</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>August 13, 1882</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>THE MASTER WAS CONVERSING with Kedār and some other devotees in his room
in the temple garden. Kedār was a government official and had spent
several years at Dāccā, in East Bengal, where he had become a friend of
Vijay Goswami. The two would spend a great part of their time together,
talking about Sri Ramakrishna and his spiritual experiences. Kedār had
once been a member of the Brahmo Samaj. He followed the path of bhakti.
Spiritual talk always brought tears to his eyes.</p>
<p>It was five o\'clock in the afternoon. Kedār was very happy that day,
having arranged a religious festival for Sri Ramakrishna. A singer had
been hired by Ram, and the whole day passed in joy.</p>
<p><strong>Secret of divine communion</strong></p>
<p>The Master explained to the devotees the secret of communion with God.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"With the realization of Satchidananda one goes into samādhi.
Then duties drop away. Suppose I have been talking about the ostad and
he arrives. What need is there of talking about him then? How long does
the bee buzz around? So long as it isn\'t sitting on a flower. But it
will not do for the sadhaka to renounce duties. He should perform his
duties, such as worship, japa, meditation, prayer, and pilgrimage.</p>
<p>\"If you see someone engaged in reasoning even after he has realized
God, you may liken him to a bee, which also buzzes a little even while
sipping honey from a flower.\"</p>
<p>The Master was highly pleased with the ostad\'s music. He said to the
musician, \"There is a special manifestation of God\'s power in a man
who has any outstanding gift, such as proficiency in music.\"</p>
<p>MUSICIAN: \"Sir, what is the way to realize God?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Bhakti is the one essential thing. To be sure, God exists in
all beings. Who, then, is a devotee? He whose mind dwells on God. But
this is not possible as long as one has egotism and vanity. The water of
God\'s grace cannot collect on the high mound of egotism. It runs down.
I am a mere machine.</p>
<p><strong>Master\'s respect for other faiths</strong></p>
<p>(To Kedār and the other devotees) \"God can be realized through all
paths. All religions are true. The important thing is to reach the roof.
You can reach it by stone stairs or by wooden stairs or by bamboo steps
or by a rope. You can also climb up by a bamboo pole.</p>
<p><strong>Many names of one God</strong></p>
<p>\"You may say that there are many errors and superstitions in another
religion. I should reply: Suppose there are. Every religion has errors.
Everyone thinks that his watch alone gives the correct time. It is
enough to have yearning for God. It is enough to love Him and feel
attracted to Him: Don\'t you know that God is the Inner Guide? He sees
the longing of our heart and the yearning of our soul. Suppose a man has
several sons. The older boys address him distinctly as \'Baba\' or
\'Papa\', but the babies can at best call him \'Ba\' or \'Pa\'. Now,
will the father be angry with those who address him in this indistinct
way? The father knows that they too are calling him, only they cannot
pronounce his name well. All children are the same to the father.
Likewise, the devotees call on God alone, though by different names.
They call on one Person only. God is one, but His names are many.\"</p>
<p><strong>Thursday, August 24, 1882.</strong></p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna was talking to Hazra on the long northeast verandah of
his room, when M. arrived. He saluted the Master reverently.</p>
<p><strong>Spiritual disciplines necessary at the beginning</strong></p>
<p>MASTER: \"I should like to visit Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar a few times
more. The painter first draws the general outlines and then puts in the
details and colours at his leisure. The moulder first makes the image
out of clay, then plasters it, then gives it a coat of whitewash, and
last of all paints it with a brush. All these steps must be taken
successively. Vidyasagar is fully ready, but his inner stuff is covered
with a thin layer. He is now engaged in doing good works; but he
doesn\'t know what is within himself. Gold is hidden within him. God
dwells within us. If one knows that, one feels like giving up all
activities and praying to God with a yearning soul.\"</p>
<p>So the Master talked with M. - now standing, now pacing up and down the
long verandah.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"A little spiritual discipline is necessary in order to know
what lies within.\"</p>
<p>M: \"Is it necessary to practise discipline all through life?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"No. But one must be up and doing in the beginning. After that
one need not work hard. The helmsman stands up and clutches the rudder
firmly as long as the boat is passing through waves, storms, high wind,
or around the curves of a river; but he relaxes after steering through
them. As soon as the boat passes the curves and the helmsman feels a
favourable wind, he sits comfortably and just touches the rudder. Next
he prepares to unfurl the sail and gets ready for a smoke. Likewise, the
aspirant enjoys peace and calm after passing the waves and storms of
\'woman and gold\'.</p>
<p><strong>\"Woman and gold\" is the obstruction to yoga</strong></p>
<p>\"Some are born with the characteristics of the yogi; but they too
should be careful. It is \'woman and gold\' alone that is the obstacle;
it makes them deviate from the path of yoga and drags them into
worldliness. Perhaps they have some desire for enjoyment. After
fulfilling their desire, they again direct their minds to God and thus
recover their former state of mind, fit for the practise of yoga.</p>
<p>\"Have you ever seen the spring trap for fish, called the
\'satka-kal\'?\"</p>
<p>M: \"No, sir, I haven\'t seen it.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"They use it in our part of the country. One end of a bamboo
pole is fastened in the ground, and the other is bent over with a catch.
From this end a line with a hook hangs over the water, with bait tied to
the hook. When the fish swallows the bait, suddenly the bamboo jumps up
and regains its upright position.</p>
<p>\"Again, take a pair of scales for example. If a weight is placed on one
side, the lower needle moves away from the upper one. The lower needle
is the mind, and the upper one, God. The meeting of the two is yoga.</p>
<p>\"Unless the mind becomes steady there cannot be yoga. It is the wind of
worldliness that always disturbs the mind, which may be likened to a
candle flame. If that flame doesn\'t move at all, then one is said to
have attained yoga.</p>
<ol>
<li>\'Woman and gold\' alone is the obstacle to yoga. Always analyse
    what you see. What is there in the body of a woman? Only such things
    as blood, flesh, fat, entrails, and the like. Why should one love
    such a body?</li>
</ol>
<p>\"Sometimes I used to assume a rajasic mood in order to practise
renunciation. Once I had the desire to put on a gold-embroidered robe,
wear a ring on my finger, and smoke a hubble-bubble with a long pipe.
Mathur Babu procured all these things for me. I wore the
gold-embroidered robe and said to myself after a while, \'Mind! This is
what is called a gold-embroidered robe.\' Then I took it off and threw
it away. I couldn\'t stand the robe any more. Again I said to myself,
\'Mind! This is called a shawl, and this a ring, and this, smoking a
hubble-bubble with a long pipe.\' I threw those things away once for
all, and the desire to enjoy them never arose in my mind again.\"</p>
<p>It was almost dusk. The Master and M. stood talking alone near the door
on the southeast verandah.</p>
<p>MASTER (to M.): \"The mind of the yogi is always fixed on God, always
absorbed in the Self. You can recognize such a man by merely looking at
him. His eyes are wide open, with an aimless look, like the eyes of the
mother bird hatching her eggs. Her entire mind is fixed on the eggs, and
there is a vacant look in her eyes. Can you show me such a picture?\"</p>
<p>M: \"I shall try to get one.\"</p>
<p>As evening came on, the temples were lighted up. Sri Ramakrishna was
seated on his small couch, meditating on the Divine Mother. Then he
chanted the names of God. Incense was burnt in the room, where an oil
lamp had been lighted. Sounds of conch-shells and gongs came floating on
the air as the evening worship began in the temple of Kāli. The light of
the moon flooded all the quarters. The Master again spoke to M.</p>
<p><strong>God and worldly duties</strong></p>
<p>MASTER: \"Perform your duties in an unselfish spirit. The work that
Vidyasagar is engaged in is very good. Always try to perform your duties
without desiring any result.\"</p>
<ol>
<li>\"Yes, sir. But may I know if one can realize God while performing
    one\'s duties? Can \'Rama\' and \'desire\' coexist? The other day I
    read in a Hindi couplet: \'Where Rama is, there desire cannot be;
    where desire is, there Rama cannot be.\' \"</li>
</ol>
<p>MASTER: \"All, without exception, perform work. Even to chant the name
and glories of God is work, as is the meditation of the non-dualist on
\'I am He\'. Breathing is also an activity. There is no way of
renouncing work altogether. So do your work, but surrender the result to
God.\"</p>
<p><strong>God and worldly duties</strong></p>
<p>M: \"Sir, may I make an effort to earn more money?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"It is permissible to do so to maintain a religious family. You
may try to increase your income, but in an honest way. The goal of life
is not the earning of money, but the service of God. Money is not
harmful if it is devoted to the service of God.\"</p>
<p>M: \"How long should a man feel obliged to do his duty toward his wife
and children?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"As long as they feel pinched for food and clothing. But one
need not take the responsibility of a son when he is able to support
himself. When the young fledgling learns to pick its own food, its
mother pecks it if it comes to her for food.\"</p>
<p>M: \"How long must one do one\'s duty?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"The blossom drops off when the fruit appears. One doesn\'t
have to do one\'s duty after the attainment of God, nor does one feel
like doing it then.</p>
<p>\"If a drunkard takes too much liquor he cannot retain consciousness. If
he takes only two or three glasses, he can go on with his work. As you
advance nearer and nearer to God, He will reduce your activities little
by little. Have no fear.</p>
<p>\"Finish the few duties you have at hand, and then you will have peace.
When the mistress of the house goes to bathe after finishing her cooking
and other household duties, she won\'t come back, however you may shout
after her.\"</p>
<p><strong>Different groups of devotees</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>\"Sir, what is the meaning of the realization of God? What do you
      mean by God-vision? How does one attain</li>
</ol>
<p>it?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"According to the Vaishnavas the aspirants and the seers of God
may be divided into different groups. These are the pravartaka, the
sadhaka, the siddha, and the siddha of the siddha. He who has just</p>
<p>set foot on the path may be called a pravartaka. He may be called a
sadhaka who has for some time been practising spiritual disciplines,
such as worship, japa, meditation, and the chanting of God\'s name and
glories. He may be called a siddha who has known from his inner
experience that God exists. An analogy is given in the Vedanta to
explain this. The master of the house is asleep in a dark room. Someone
is groping in the darkness to find him. He touches the couch and says,
\'No, it is not he.\' He touches the window and says, \'No, it is not
he.\' He touches the door and says, \'No, it is not he.\' This is known
in the Vedanta as the process of \'Neti, neti\', \'Not this, not this\'.
At last his hand touches the master\'s body and he exclaims, \'Here he
is!\' In other words, he is now conscious of the \'existence\' of the
master. He has found him, but he doesn\'t yet know him intimately.</p>
<p>\"There is another type, known as the siddha of the siddha, the
\'supremely perfect\'. It is quite a different thing when one talks to
the master intimately, when one knows God very intimately through love
and devotion. A siddha has undoubtedly attained God, but the \'supremely
perfect\' has known God very intimately.</p>
<p><strong>Different moods of aspirants</strong></p>
<p>\"But in order to realize God, one must assume one of these attitudes:
Śānta, Dāsya, sakhya, Vātsalya, or Madhur.</p>
<p>\"Śānta, the serene attitude. The rishis of olden times had this
attitude toward God. They did not desire any worldly enjoyment. It is
like the single-minded devotion of a wife to her husband. She knows that
her husband is the embodiment of beauty and love, a veritable Madan.</p>
<p>\"Dāsya, the attitude of a servant toward his master. Hanuman had this
attitude toward Rama. He felt the strength of a lion when he worked for
Rama. A wife feels this mood also. She serves her husband with all her
heart and soul. A mother also has a little of this attitude, as Yaśoda
had toward Krishna.</p>
<p>\"Sakhya, the attitude of friendship. Friends say to one another, \'Come
here and sit near me.\' Sridāmā and other friends sometimes fed Krishna
with fruit, part of which they had already eaten, and sometimes climbed
on His shoulders.</p>
<p>\"Vātsalya, the attitude of a mother toward her child. This was
Yaśoda\'s attitude toward Krishna. The wife, too, has a little of this.
She feeds her husband with her very life-blood, as it were. The mother
feels happy only when the child has eaten to his heart\'s content.
Yaśoda would roam about with butter in her hand, in order to feed
Krishna.</p>
<p>\"Madhur, the attitude of a woman toward her paramour. Radha had this
attitude toward Krishna. The wife also feels it for her husband. This
attitude includes all the other four.\"</p>
<p>M: \"When one sees God does one see Him with these eyes?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"God cannot be seen with these physical eyes. In the course of
spiritual discipline one gets a \'love body\', endowed with \'love
eyes\', \'love ears\', and so on. One sees God with those \'love eyes\'.
One hears the voice of God with those \'love ears\'. One even gets a
sexual organ made of love.\"</p>
<p>At these words M. burst out laughing. The Master continued, unannoyed,
\"With this \'love body\' the soul communes with God.\"</p>
<p>M. again became serious.</p>
<p><strong>Seeing God everywhere</strong></p>
<p>MASTER: \"But this is not possible without intense love of God. One sees
nothing but God everywhere when one loves Him with great intensity. It
is like a person with jaundice, who sees everything yellow. Then one
feels, \'I am verily He\'.</p>
<p>\"A drunkard, deeply intoxicated, says, \'Verily I am Kāli!\' The gopis,
intoxicated with love, exclaimed, \'Verily I am Krishna!\'</p>
<p>\"One who thinks of God, day and night, beholds Him everywhere. It is
like a man\'s seeing flames on all sides after he has gazed fixedly at
one flame for some time.\"</p>
<p>\"But that isn\'t the real flame\", flashed through M.\'s mind.</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna, who could read a man\'s inmost thought, said: \"One
doesn\'t lose consciousness by thinking of Him who is all Spirit, all
Consciousness. Shivanath once remarked that too much thinking about God
confounds the brain. Thereupon I said to him, \'How can one become
unconscious by thinking of Consciousness?\' \"</p>
<ol>
<li>\"Yes, sir, I realize that. It isn\'t like thinking of an unreal
    object. How can a man lose his intelligence if he always fixes his
    mind on Him whose very nature is eternal Intelligence?\"</li>
</ol>
<p>MASTER (with pleasure): \"It is through God\'s grace that you understand
that. The doubts of the mind will not disappear without His grace.
Doubts do not disappear without Self-realization.</p>
<p>\"But one need not fear anything if one has received the grace of God.
It is rather easy for a child to stumble if he holds his father\'s hand;
but there can be no such fear if the father holds the child\'s hand. A
man does not have to suffer any more if God, in His grace, removes his
doubts and reveals Himself to him. But this grace descends upon him only
after he has prayed to God with intense yearning of heart and practised
spiritual discipline. The mother feels compassion for her child when she
sees him running about breathlessly. She has been hiding herself; now
she appears before the child.\"</p>
<p>\"But why should God make us run about?\" thought M</p>
<p>Immediately Sri Ramakrishna said: \"It is His will that we should run
about a little. Then it is great fun. God has created the world in play,
as it were. This is called Mahamaya, the Great Illusion. Therefore one
must take refuge in the Divine Mother, the Cosmic Power Itself. It is
She who has bound us with the shackles of illusion. The realization of
God is possible only when those shackles are severed.\"</p>
<p><strong>Worship of the Divine Mother</strong></p>
<p>The Master continued: \"One must propitiate the Divine Mother, the
Primal Energy, in order to obtain God\'s grace. God Himself is Mahamaya,
who deludes the world with Her illusion and conjures up the magic of
creation, preservation, and destruction. She has spread this veil of
ignorance before our eyes. We can go into the inner chamber only when
She lets us pass through the door. Living outside, we see only outer
objects, but not that Eternal Being, Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute.
Therefore it is stated in the purna that deities like Brahma praised
Mahamaya for the destruction of the demons Madhu and Kaitabha.</p>
<p>\"Śakti alone is the root of the universe. That Primal Energy has two
aspects: vidyā and avidyā. Avidyā deludes. Avidyā conjures up \'woman
and gold\', which casts the spell. Vidyā begets devotion, kindness,
wisdom, and love, which lead one to God. This avidyā must be
propitiated, and that is the purpose of the rites of Śakti worship.</p>
<p>\"The devotee assumes various attitudes toward Śakti in order to
propitiate Her: the attitude of a handmaid, a \'hero\', or a child. A
hero\'s attitude is to please Her even as a man pleases a woman through
intercourse.</p>
<p>\"The worship of Śakti is extremely difficult. It is no joke. I passed
two years as the handmaid and companion of the Divine Mother. But my
natural attitude has always been that of a child toward its mother. I
regard the breasts of any woman as those of my own mother.</p>
<p><strong>Master\'s attitude toward women</strong></p>
<p>\"Women are, all of them, the veritable images of Śakti. In northwest
India the bride holds a knife in her hand</p>
<p>at the time of marriage; in Bengal, a nut-cutter. The meaning is that
the bridegroom, with the help of the bride, who is the embodiment of the
Divine Power, will sever the bondage of illusion. This is the \'heroic\'
attitude. I never worshipped the Divine Mother that way. My attitude
toward Her is that of a child toward its mother.</p>
<p>\"The bride is the very embodiment of Śakti. Haven\'t you noticed, at
the marriage ceremony, how the groom sits behind like an idiot? But the
bride - she is so bold!</p>
<p><strong>His love for Narendra</strong></p>
<p>\"After attaining God one forgets His external splendour; the glories of
His creation. One doesn\'t think of God\'s glories after one has seen
Him. The devotee, once immersed in God\'s Bliss, doesn\'t calculate any
more about outer things. When I see Narendra, I don\'t need to ask him:
\'What\'s your name? Where do you live?\' Where is the time for such
questions? Once a man asked Hanuman which day of the fortnight it was.
\'Brother,\' said Hanuman, \'I don\'t know anything of the day of the
week, or the fortnight, or the position of the stars. I think of Rama
alone.\' \"</p>
<p><strong>October 16, 1882</strong></p>
<p>It was Monday, a few days before the Durga Puja, the festival of the
Divine Mother. Sri Ramakrishna was in a very happy state of mind, for
Narendra was with him. Narendra had brought two or three young members
of the Brahmo Samaj to the temple garden. Besides these, Rakhal, Ramlal,
Hazra, and M. were with the Master.</p>
<p>Narendra had his midday meal with Sri Ramakrishna. Afterwards a
temporary bed was made on the floor of the Master\'s room so that the
disciples might rest awhile. A mat was spread, over which was placed a
quilt covered with a white sheet. A few cushions and pillows completed
the simple bed. Like a child, the Master sat near Narendranath on the
bed. He talked with the devotees in great delight. With a radiant smile
lighting his face, and his eyes fixed on Narendra, he was giving them
various spiritual teachings, interspersing these with incidents from his
own life.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"After I had experienced samādhi, my mind craved intensely to
hear only about God. I would always search for places where they were
reciting or explaining the sacred books, such as the Bhagavata, the
Mahabharata, and the Adhyātma Rāmāyana. I used to go to Krishnakishore
to hear him read the Adhyātma Rāmāyana.</p>
<p><strong>Krishnakishore\'s faith</strong></p>
<p>\"What tremendous faith Krishnakishore had! Once, while at Vrindāvan, he
felt thirsty and went to a well. Near it he saw a man standing. On being
asked to draw a little water for him, the man said: \'I belong to a low
caste, sir. You are a brahmin. How can I draw water for you?\'
Krishnakishore said: \'Take the name of Śiva. By repeating His holy name
you will make yourself pure.\' The low-caste man did as he was told, and
Krishnakishore, orthodox brahmin that he was, drank that water. What
tremendous faith!</p>
<p>\"Once a holy man came to the bank of the Ganges and lived near the
bathing-ghat at Ariadaha, not far from Dakshineswar. We thought of
paying him a visit. I said to Haladhāri: \'Krishnakishore and I are
going to see a holy man. Will you come with us?\' Haladhāri replied,
\'What is the use of seeing a mere human body, which is no better than a
cage of clay?\' Haladhāri was a student of the Gita and Vedanta
philosophy, and therefore referred to the holy man as a mere \'cage of
clay\'. I repeated this to Krishnakishore. With great anger he said:
\'How impudent of Haladhāri to make such a remark! How can he ridicule
as a \"cage of clay\" the body of a man who constantly thinks of God,
who meditates on Rama, and has renounced all for the sake of the Lord?
Doesn\'t he know that such a man is the embodiment of Spirit?\' He was
so upset by Haladhāri\'s remarks that he would turn his face away from
him whenever he met him in the temple garden, and stopped speaking to
him.</p>
<p>\"Once Krishnakishore asked me, \'Why have you cast off the sacred
thread?\' In those days of God-vision I felt</p>
<p>as if I were passing through the great storm of Āświn, and everything
had blown away from me. No trace of my old self was left. I lost all
consciousness of the world. I could hardly keep my cloth on my body, not
to speak of the sacred thread! I said to Krishnakishore, \'Ah, you will
understand if you ever happen to be as intoxicated with God as I was.\'</p>
<p>\"And it actually came to pass. He too passed through a God-intoxicated
state, when he would repeat only the word \'Om\' and shut himself up
alone in his room. His relatives thought he was actually mad, and called
in a physician. Ram Kaviraj of Natagore came to see him. Krishnakishore
said to the physician, \'Cure me, sir, of my malady, if you please, but
not of my Om.\' (All laugh.)</p>
<p>\"One day I went to see him and found him in a pensive mood. When I
asked him about it, he said: \'The tax-collector was here. He threatened
to dispose of my brass pots, my cups, and my few utensils, if I didn\'t
pay the tax; so I am worried.\' I said: \'But why should you worry about
it? Let him take away your pots and pans. Let him arrest your body even.
How will that affect you? For your nature is that of Kha!\' (Narendra
and the others laugh.) He used to say to me that he was the Spirit,
all-pervading as the sky. He had got that idea from the Adhyātma
Rāmāyana. I used to tease him now and then, addressing him as \'Kha\'.
Therefore I said to him that day, with a smile: \'You are Kha. Taxes
cannot move you!\'</p>
<p><strong>Master\'s outspokenness</strong></p>
<p>\"In that state of God-intoxication I used to speak out my mind to all.
I was no respecter of persons. Even to men of position I was not afraid
to speak the truth.</p>
<p>\"One day Jatindra came to the garden of Jadu Mallick. I was there too.
I asked him: \'What is the duty of man? Isn\'t it our duty to think of
God?\' Jatindra replied: \'We are worldly people. How is it possible for
us to achieve liberation? Even King Yudhisthira had to have a vision of
hell.\' This made me very angry. I said to him: \'What sort of man are
you? Of all the incidents of Yudhisthira\'s life, you remember only his
seeing hell. You don\'t remember his truthfulness, his forbearance, his
patience, his discrimination, his dispassion, his devotion to God.\' I
was about to say many more things, when Hriday stopped my mouth. After a
little while Jatindra left the place, saying he had some other business
to attend to.</p>
<p>\"Many days later I went with Captain to see Rājā Sourindra Tagore. As
soon as I met him, I said, \'I can\'t address you as \"Rājā\", or by any
such title, for I should be telling a lie.\' He talked to me a few
minutes, but even so our conversation was interrupted by the frequent
visits of Europeans and others. A man of rajasic temperament, Sourindra
was naturally busy with many things. Jatindra his eldest brother, had
been told of my coming, but he sent word that he had a pain in his
throat and couldn\'t go out.</p>
<p>\"One day, in that state of divine intoxication, I went to the
bathing-ghat on the Ganges at Baranagore. There I saw Jaya Mukherji
repeating the name of God; but his mind was on something else. I went up
and slapped him twice on the cheeks.</p>
<p>\"At one time Rani Rasmani was staying in the temple garden. She came to
the shrine of the Divine Mother, as she frequently did when I worshipped
Kāli, and asked me to sing a song or two. On this occasion, while I was
singing, I noticed she was sorting the flowers for worship
absent-mindedly. At once I slapped her on the cheeks. She became quite
embarrassed and sat there with folded hands.</p>
<p>\"Alarmed at this state of mind myself, I said to my cousin Haladhāri:
\'Just see my nature! How can I get rid of it?\' After praying to the
Divine Mother for some time with great yearning, I was able to shake off
this habit.</p>
<p><strong>His anguish at worldly talk</strong></p>
<p>\"When one gets into such a state of mind, one doesn\'t enjoy any
conversation but that about God. I used to weep when I heard people talk
about worldly matters. When I accompanied Mathur Babu on a pilgrimage,
we spent a few days in Benares at Raja Babu\'s house. One day I was
seated in the drawing-room with Mathur Babu, Raja Babu, and others.
Hearing them talk about various worldly things, such as their business
losses and so forth, I wept bitterly and said to the Divine Mother:
\'Mother, where have You brought me? I was much</p>
<p>better off in the temple garden at Dakshineswar. Here I am in a place
where I must bear about \"woman and gold\". But at Dakshineswar I could
avoid it.\' \"</p>
<p>The Master asked the devotees, especially Narendra, to rest awhile, and
he himself lay down on the smaller couch.</p>
<p><strong>His ecstasy in Kirtan</strong></p>
<p>Late in the afternoon Narendra sang. Rakhal, Lātu, M., Hazra, and Priya,
Narendra\'s Brahmo friend, were present. The singing was accompanied by
the drum:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Meditate, O my mind, on the Lord Hari,</em></p>
<p><em>The Stainless One, Pure Spirit through and through.</em></p>
<p><em>How peerless is the light that in Him shines!</em></p>
<p><em>How soul-bewitching is His wondrous form!</em></p>
<p><em>How dear is He to all His devotees!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After this song Narendra sang:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Oh, when will dawn for me that day of blessedness</em></p>
<p><em>When He who is all Good, all Beauty, and all Truth,</em></p>
<p><em>Will light the inmost shrine of my heart?</em></p>
<p><em>When shall I sink at last, ever beholding Him,</em></p>
<p><em>Into that Ocean of Delight?</em></p>
<p><em>Lord, as Infinite Wisdom Thou shalt enter my soul,</em></p>
<p><em>And my unquiet mind, made speechless by Thy sight,</em></p>
<p><em>Will find a haven at Thy feet.</em></p>
<p><em>In my heart\'s firmament, O Lord, Thou wilt arise</em></p>
<p><em>As Blissful Immortality;</em></p>
<p><em>And as, when the chakora beholds the rising moon,</em></p>
<p><em>It sports about for very joy,</em></p>
<p><em>So, too, shall I be filled with heavenly happiness</em></p>
<p><em>When Thou appearest unto me.</em></p>
<p><em>Thou One without a Second, all Peace, the King of Kings!</em></p>
<p><em>At Thy beloved feet I shall renounce my life</em></p>
<p><em>And so at last shall gain life\'s goal;</em></p>
<p><em>1 shall enjoy the bliss of heaven while yet on earth!</em></p>
<p><em>Where else is a boon so rare bestowed?</em></p>
<p><em>Then shall I see Thy glory, pure and untouched by stain;</em></p>
<p><em>As darkness flees from 1ight, so will my darkest sins</em></p>
<p><em>Desert me at Thy dawn\'s approach.</em></p>
<p><em>Kindle in me, O Lord, the blazing fire of faith</em></p>
<p><em>To be the pole-star of my life;</em></p>
<p><em>O Succour of the weak, fulfil my one desire!</em></p>
<p><em>Then shall I bathe both day and night</em></p>
<p><em>In the boundless bliss of Thy Love, and utterly forget</em></p>
<p><em>Myself, O Lord, attaining Thee.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Narendra sang again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>With beaming face chant the sweet name of God</em></p>
<p><em>Till in your heart the nectar overflows.</em></p>
<p><em>Drink of it ceaselessly and share it with all!</em></p>
<p><em>If ever your heart runs dry, parched by the flames</em></p>
<p><em>Of worldly desire, chant the sweet name of God,</em></p>
<p><em>And heavenly love will moisten your arid soul.</em></p>
<p><em>Be sure, O mind, you never forget to chant</em></p>
<p><em>His holy name: when danger stares in your face,</em></p>
<p><em>Call on Him, your Father Compassionate;</em></p>
<p><em>With His name\'s thunder, snap the fetters of sin!</em></p>
<p><em>Come, let us fulfil our hearts\' desires</em></p>
<p><em>By drinking deep of Everlasting Joy,</em></p>
<p><em>Made one with Him in Love\'s pure ecstasy.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now Narendra and the devotees began to sing kirtan, accompanied by the
drum and cymbals. They moved round and round the Master as they sang:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Immerse yourself for evermore, O mind,</em></p>
<p><em>In Him who is Pure Knowledge and Pure Bliss.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next they sang:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Oh, when will dawn for me that day of blessedness</em></p>
<p><em>When He who is all Good, all Beauty, and all Truth</em></p>
<p><em>Will light the inmost shrine of my heart?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At last Narendra himself was playing on the drums, and he sang with the
Master, full of joy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>With beaming face chant the sweet name of God</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the music was over, Sri Ramakrishna held Narendra in his arms a
long time and said, \"You have made us so happy today!\" The flood-gate
of the Master\'s heart was open so wide, that night, that he could
hardly contain himself for joy. It was eight o\'clock in the evening.
Intoxicated with divine love, he paced the long verandah north of his
room. Now and then he could be heard talking to the Divine Mother.
Suddenly he said in an excited voice, \"What can you do to me?\" Was the
Master hinting that maya was helpless before him, since he had the
Divine Mother for his support?</p>
<p>Narendra, M., and Priya were going to spend the night at the temple
garden. This pleased the Master highly, especially since Narendra would
be with him. The Holy Mother, who was living in the nahabat, had
prepared the supper. Surendra bore the greater part of the Master\'s
expenses. The meal was ready, and the plates were set out on the
southeast verandah of the Masters room.</p>
<p>Near the east door of his room Narendra and the other devotees were
gossiping.</p>
<p>NARENDRA: \"How do you find the young men nowadays?\"</p>
<p>M: \"They are not bad; but they don\'t receive any religious
instructions\".</p>
<p>NARENDRA: \"But from my experience I feel they are going to the dogs.
They smoke cigarettes, indulge in frivolous talk, enjoy foppishness,
play truant, and do everything of that sort. I have even seen them
visiting questionable places.\"</p>
<p>M: \"I didn\'t notice such things during our student days.\"</p>
<p>NARENDRA: \"Perhaps you didn\'t mix with the students intimately. I have
even seen them talking with people of immoral character. Perhaps they
are on terms of intimacy with them.\"</p>
<p>M: \"It is strange indeed.\"</p>
<p>NARENDRA: \"I know that many of them form bad habits. It would be proper
if the guardians of the boys, and the authorities, kept their eyes on
these matters.\"</p>
<p>They Were talking thus when Sri Ramakrishna came to them and asked with
a smile, \"Well, what are you talking about?\"</p>
<p>NARENDRA: \"I have been asking M. about the boys in the schools. The
conduct of students nowadays isn\'t all that it should be.\"</p>
<p>The Master became grave and said to M. rather seriously: \"This kind of
conversation is not good. It isn\'t desirable to indulge in any talk but
talk of God. You are their senior, and you are intelligent. You should
not have encouraged them to talk about such matters.\"</p>
<p>Narendra was then about nineteen years old, and M. about twenty-eight.
Thus admonished, M. felt embarrassed, and the others also fell silent.</p>
<p>While the devotees were enjoying their meal, Sri Ramakrishna stood by
and watched them with intense delight. That night the Master\'s joy was
very great.</p>
<p>After supper the devotees rested on the mat spread on the floor of the
Master\'s room. They began to talk with him. It was indeed a mart of
joy. The Master asked Narendra to sing the song beginning with the line:
\"In Wisdom\'s firmament the moon of Love is rising full.\"</p>
<p>Narendra sang, and other devotees played the drums and cymbals:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In Wisdom\'s firmament the moon of Love is rising full,</em></p>
<p><em>And Love\'s flood-tide, in surging waves, is flowing everywhere.</em></p>
<p><em>O Lord, how full of bliss Thou art! Victory unto Thee!</em></p>
<p><em>On every side shine devotees, like stars around the moon;</em></p>
<p><em>Their Friend, the Lord All-merciful, joyously plays with them.</em></p>
<p><em>Behold! the gates of paradise today are open wide.</em></p>
<p><em>The soft spring wind of the New Day raises fresh waves of joy; Gently
it carries to the earth the fragrance of God\'s Love, Till all the
yogis, drunk with bliss, are lost in ecstasy.</em></p>
<p><em>Upon the sea of the world unfolds the lotus of the New Day,</em></p>
<p><em>And there the Mother sits enshrined in blissful majesty.</em></p>
<p><em>See how the bees are mad with joy, sipping the nectar there!</em></p>
<p><em>Behold the Mother\'s radiant face, which so enchants the heart And
captivates the universe! About Her Lotus Feet Bands of ecstatic holy
men are dancing in delight.</em></p>
<p><em>What matchless loveliness is Hers! What infinite content Pervades the
heart when She appears! O brothers, says Premdas, I humbly beg you,
one and all, to sing the Mother\'s praise!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna sang and danced, and the devotees danced around him.</p>
<p><strong>A devotee\'s dream</strong></p>
<p>When the song was over, the Master walked up and down the northeast
verandah, where Hazra was seated</p>
<p>with M. The Master sat down there. He asked a devotee, \"Do you ever
have dreams?\"</p>
<p>DEVOTEE: \"Yes, sir. The other day I dreamt a strange dream. I saw the
whole world enveloped in water. There was water on all sides. A few
boats were visible, but suddenly huge waves appeared and sank them. I
was about to board a ship with a few others, when we saw a brahmin
walking over that expanse of water. I asked him, \'How can you walk over
the deep?\' The brahmin said with a smile: \'Oh, there is no difficulty
about that. There is a bridge under the water.\' I said to him, \'Where
are you going?\' \'To Bhawanipur, the city of the Divine Mother\', he
replied. \'Wait a little\', I cried. \'I shall accompany you.\' \"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Oh. I am thrilled to hear the story!\"</p>
<p>DEVOTEE: \"The brahmin said: \'I am in a hurry. It will take you some
time to get out of the boat. Good-bye.</p>
<p>Remember this path and come after me.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Oh, my hair is standing on end! Please be initiated by a guru
as soon as possible.\"</p>
<p>Shortly before midnight Narendra and the other devotees lay down on a
bed made on the floor of the Master\'s room.</p>
<p>At dawn some of the devotees were up. They saw the Master, naked as a
child, pacing up and down the room, repeating the names of the various
gods and goddesses. His voice was sweet as nectar. Now he would look at
the Ganges, now stop in front of the pictures hanging on the wall and
bow down before them, chanting all the while the holy names in his sweet
voice. He chanted: \"Veda, Purana, Tantra; Gita, Gayatri; Bhagavata,
Bhakta, Bhagavan.\" Referring to the Gita, he repeated many times,
\"Tagi, tagi, tagi.\" Now and then he would say: \"O Mother, Thou art
verily Brahman, and Thou art verily Śakti. Thou art Purusha and Thou art
Prakriti. Thou art Virat. Thou art the Absolute, and Thou dost manifest
Thyself as the Relative. Thou art verily the twenty-four cosmic
principles.\"</p>
<p>In the mean time the morning service had begun in the temples of Kāli
and Radhakanta. Sounds of conch-shells and cymbals were carried on the
air. The devotees came outside the room and saw the priests and servants
gathering flowers in the garden for the divine service in the temples.
From the nahabat floated the sweet melody of musical instruments,
befitting the morning hours.</p>
<p>Narendra and the other devotees finished their morning duties and came
to the Master. With a sweet smile on his lips Sri Ramakrishna was
standing on the northeast verandah, close to his own room.</p>
<p>NARENDRA: \"We noticed several sannyasis belonging to the sect of Nanak
in the Panchavati.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Yes, they arrived here yesterday. (To Narendra) I\'d like to
see you all sitting together on the mat.\"</p>
<p>As they sat there the Master looked at them with evident delight. He
then began to talk with them. Narendra asked about spiritual discipline.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Bhakti, love of God, is the essence of all spiritual
discipline. Through love one acquires renunciation and discrimination
naturally.\"</p>
<p><strong>Disciplines of Tantra</strong></p>
<p>NARENDRA: \"Isn\'t it true that the Tantra prescribes spiritual
discipline in the company of woman?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"That is not desirable. It is a very difficult path and often
causes the aspirant\'s downfall. There are three such kinds of
discipline. One may regard woman as one\'s mistress or look on oneself
as her handmaid or as her child. I look on woman as my mother. To look
on oneself as her handmaid is also good; but it is extremely difficult
to practise spiritual discipline looking on woman as one\'s mistress. To
regard oneself as her child is a very pure attitude.\"</p>
<p>The sannyasis belonging to the sect of Nanak entered the room and
greeted the Master, saying, \"Namo</p>
<p>Narayanaya.\" Sri Ramakrishna asked them to sit down.</p>
<p><strong>All is possible with God</strong></p>
<p>MASTFR: \"Nothing is impossible for God. Nobody can describe His nature
in words. Everything is possible for Him. There lived at a certain place
two yogis who were practising spiritual discipline. The sage Narada was
passing that way one day. Realizing who he was, one of the yogis said:
\'You have just come from God Himself. What is He doing now?\' Narada
replied, \'Why, I saw Him making camels and elephants pass and repass
through the eye of a needle.\' At this the yogi said: \'Is that anything
to wonder at? Everything is possible for God.\' But the other yogi said:
\'What? Making elephants pass through the eye of a needle - is that ever
possible? You have never been to the Lord\'s dwelling-place.\' \"</p>
<p>At nine o\'clock in the morning, while the Master was still sitting in
his room, Manomohan arrived from Konnagar with some members of his
family. In answer to Sri Ramakrishna\'s kind inquiries, Manomohan
explained that he was taking them to Calcutta. The Master said: \"Today
is the first day of the Bengali month, an inauspicious day for
undertaking a journey. I hope everything will be well with you.\" With a
smile he began to talk of other matters.</p>
<p>When Narendra and his friends had finished bathing in the Ganges, the
Master said to them earnestly: \"Go to the Panchavati and meditate there
under the banyan-tree. Shall I give you something to sit on?\"</p>
<p><strong>Discrimination and dispassion</strong></p>
<p>About half past ten Narendra and his Brahmo friends were meditating in
the Panchavati. After a while Sri Ramakrishna came to them. M., too, was
present.</p>
<p>The Master said to the Brahmo devotees: \"In meditation one must be
absorbed in God. By merely floating on the surface of the water, can you
reach the gems lying at the bottom of the sea?\"</p>
<p>Then he sang:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Taking the name of Kāli, dive deep down,</em></p>
<p><em>O mind, Into the heart\'s fathomless depths,</em></p>
<p><em>Where many a precious gem lies hid.</em></p>
<p><em>But never believe the bed of the ocean bare of gems</em></p>
<p><em>If in the first few dives you fail;</em></p>
<p><em>With firm resolve and self-control</em></p>
<p><em>Dive deep and make your way to Mother Kāli\'s realm.</em></p>
<p><em>Down in the ocean depths of heavenly Wisdom lie</em></p>
<p><em>The wondrous pearls of Peace, O mind;</em></p>
<p><em>And you yourself can gather them,</em></p>
<p><em>If you but have pure love and follow the scriptures\' rule.</em></p>
<p><em>Within those ocean depths, as well,</em></p>
<p><em>Six alligators, lurk - lust, anger, and the rest -</em></p>
<p><em>Swimming about in search of prey.</em></p>
<p><em>Smear yourself with the turmeric of discrimination;</em></p>
<p><em>The very smell of it will shield you from their jaws.</em></p>
<p><em>Upon the ocean bed lie strewn</em></p>
<p><em>Unnumbered pearls and precious gems;</em></p>
<p><em>Plunge in, says Ramprasad, and gather up handfuls there!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Narendra and his friends came down from their seats on the raised
platform of the Panchavati and stood near the Master. He returned to his
room with them. The Master continued: \"When you plunge in the water of
the ocean, you may be attacked by alligators. But they won\'t touch you
if your body is smeared with turmeric. There are no doubt six
alligators - lust, anger, avarice, and so on - within you, in the
\'heart\'s fathomless</p>
<p>depths\'. But protect yourself with the turmeric of discrimination and
renunciation, and they won\'t touch you.</p>
<p><strong>Futility of mere lecturing</strong></p>
<p>\"What can you achieve by mere lecturing and scholarship without
discrimination and dispassion? God alone is real, and all else is
unreal. God alone is substance, and all else is nonentity. That is
discrimination.</p>
<p>\"First of all set up God in the shrine of your heart, and then deliver
lectures as much as you like. How will the mere repetition of \'Brahma\'
profit you if you are not imbued with discrimination and dispassion? It
is the empty sound of a conch-shell.</p>
<p>\"There lived in a village a young man named Padmalochan. People used to
call him \'Podo\', for short. In this village there was a temple in a
very dilapidated condition. It contained no image of God. Aśwattha and
other plants sprang up on the ruins of its walls. Bats lived inside, and
the floor was covered with dust and the droppings of the bats. The
people of the village had stopped visiting the temple. One day after
dusk the villagers heard the sound of a conch-shell from the direction
of the temple. They thought perhaps someone had installed an image in
the shrine and was performing the evening worship. One of them softly
opened the door and saw Padmalochan standing in a corner, blowing the
conch. No image had been set up. The temple hadn\'t been swept or
washed. And filth and dirt lay everywhere. Then he shouted to Podo:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>You have set up no image here,</em></p>
<p><em>Within the shrine, O fool!</em></p>
<p><em>Blowing the conch, you simply make</em></p>
<p><em>Confusion worse confounded.</em></p>
<p><em>Day and night eleven bats</em></p>
<p><em>Scream there incessantly.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Purification of mind</strong></p>
<p>\"There is no use in merely making a noise if you want to establish the
Deity in the shrine of your heart, if you want to realize God. First of
all purify the mind. In the pure heart God takes His seat. One cannot
bring the holy image into the temple if the droppings of bats are all
around. The eleven bats are our eleven organs: five of action, five of
perception, and the mind.</p>
<p>\"First of all invoke the Deity, and then give lectures to your heart\'s
content. First of all dive deep. Plunge to the bottom and gather up the
gems. Then you may do other things. But nobody wants to plunge. People
are without spiritual discipline and prayer, without renunciation and
dispassion. They learn a few words and immediately start to deliver
lectures. It is difficult to teach others. Only if a man gets a command
from God, after realizing Him, is he entitled to teach.\"</p>
<p>Thus conversing, the Master came to the west end of the verandah. M
stood by his side. Sri Ramakrishna had repeated again and again that God
cannot be realized without discrimination and renunciation. This made M.
extremely worried. He had married and was then a young man of
twenty-eight, educated in college in the Western way. Having a sense of
duty, he asked himself, \"Do discrimination and dispassion mean giving
up \'woman and gold\'?\" He was really at a loss to know what to do.</p>
<p>M. (to the Master): \"What should one do if one\'s wife says: \'You are
neglecting me. I shall commit suicide?\' \"</p>
<p>MASTER (in a serious tone): \"Give up such a wife if she proves an
obstacle in the way of spiritual life. Let her commit suicide or
anything else she likes. The wife that hampers her husband\'s spiritual
life is an ungodly wife.\"</p>
<p>Immersed in deep thought, M. stood leaning against the wall. Narendra
and the other devotees remained silent a few minutes. The Master
exchanged several words with them; then, suddenly going to M., he
whispered in his ear: \"But if a man has sincere love for God, then all
come under his control - the king, wicked persons, and his wife. Sincere
love of God on the husband\'s part may eventually help the wife to lead
a</p>
<p>spiritual life. If the husband is good, then through the grace of God
the wife may also follow his example.\"</p>
<p>This had a most soothing effect on M.\'s worried mind. All the while he
had been thinking: \"Let her commit suicide. What can I do?\"</p>
<p>M. (to the Master): \"This world is a terrible place indeed.\"</p>
<p>MASTER (to the devotees): \"That is the reason Chaitanya said to his
companion Nityananda, \'Listen, brother, there is no hope of salvation
for the worldly-minded.\' \"</p>
<p>On another occasion the Master had said to M. privately: \"Yes, there is
no hope for a worldly man if he is not sincerely devoted to God. But he
has nothing to fear if he remains in the world after realizing God. Nor
need a man have any fear whatever of the world if he attains sincere
devotion by practising spiritual discipline now and then in solitude.
Chaitanya had several householders among his devotees, but they were
householders in name only, for they lived unattached to the world.\"</p>
<p>It was noon. The worship was over, and food offerings had been made in
the temple. The doors of the temple were shut. Sri Ramakrishna sat down
for his meal, and Narendra and the other devotees partook of the food
offerings from the temple.</p>
<p><strong>Sunday, October 22, 1882</strong></p>
<p>It was the day of Vijaya, the last day of the celebration of the worship
of Durga, when the clay image is immersed in the water of a lake or
river.</p>
<p>About nine o\'clock in the morning M. was seated on the floor of the
Master\'s room at Dakshineswar, near Sri Ramakrishna, who was reclining
on the small couch. Rakhal was then living with the Master, and Narendra
and Bhavanath visited him frequently. Baburam had seen him only once or
twice.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Did you have any holiday during the Durga Puja?\"</p>
<ol>
<li>\"Yes, sir. I went to Keshab\'s house every day for the first
      three days of the worship.\" MASTER: \"Is that so?\"</li>
</ol>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
23. \"I heard there a very interesting interpretation of the Durga
    Puja.\" MASTER: \"Please tell me all about it.\"</p>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
23. \"Keshab Sen held daily morning prayers in his house, lasting till
    ten or eleven. During these prayers he gave the inner meaning of the
    Durga Puja. He said that if anyone could realize the Divine Mother,
    that is to say, could install Mother Durga in the shrine of his
    heart, then Lakshmi, Sarasvati, Kartika, and Ganesa would come there
    of themselves. Lakshmi means wealth, Sarasvati knowledge, Kartika
    strength, and Ganesa success. By realizing the Divine Mother within
    one\'s heart, one gets all these without any effort whatever.\"</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna listened to the description, questioning M. now and then
about the prayers conducted by Keshab. At last he said to M.: \"Don\'t
go hither and thither. Come here alone. Those who belong to the inner
circle of my devotees will come only here. Boys like Narendra,
Bhavanath, and Rakhal are my very intimate disciples. They are not to be
thought lightly of. Feed13 them one day. What do you think of
Narendra?\"</p>
<ol>
<li>\"I think very highly of him, sir.\" Narendra\'s many virtues</li>
</ol>
<p>MASTER: \"Haven\'t you observed his many virtues? He is not only well
versed in music, vocal and instrumental, but he is also very learned.
Besides, he has controlled his passions and declares he will lead a
celibate life. He has been devoted to God since his very boyhood.</p>
<p><strong>Meditation on God with form</strong></p>
<p>\"How are you getting along with your meditation nowadays? What aspect
of God appeals to your mind - with form or without form?\"</p>
<ol>
<li>\"Sir, now I can\'t fix my mind on God with form. On the other hand,
    I can\'t concentrate steadily on God without form.\"</li>
</ol>
<p>MASTER: \"Now you see that the mind cannot be fixed, all of a sudden, on
the formless aspect of God. It is wise to think of God with form during
the primary stages.\"</p>
<ol>
<li>\"Do you mean to suggest that one should meditate on clay images?\"
    MASTER: \"Why clay? These images are the embodiments of
    Consciousness.\"</li>
</ol>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
5888. \"Even so, one must think of hands, feet, and the other parts of
      body. But again, I realize that the mind cannot be concentrated
      unless one meditates, in the beginning, on God with form. You have
      told me so. Well, God can easily assume different forms. May one
      meditate on the form of one\'s own mother?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Yes, the mother should be adored. She is indeed an embodiment
of Brahman.\"</p>
<p>M. sat in silence. After a few minutes he asked the Master: \"What does
one feel while thinking of God without form? Isn\'t it possible to
describe it?\" After some reflection, the Master said, \"Do you know
what it is like?\" He remained silent a moment and then said a few words
to M. about one\'s experiences at the time of the vision of God with and
without form.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"You see, one must practise spiritual discipline to understand
this correctly. Suppose, there are treasures in a room. If you want to
see them and lay hold of them, you must take the trouble to get the key
and unlock the door. After that you must take the treasures out. But
suppose the room is locked, and standing outside the door you say to
yourself: \'Here I have opened the door. Now I have broken the lock of
the chest. Now I have taken out the treasure.\' Such brooding near the
door will not enable you to achieve anything. You must practise
discipline.</p>
<p><strong>Brahman and Divine Incarnations</strong></p>
<p>\"The jnanis think of God without form. They don\'t accept the Divine
Incarnation. Praising Sri Krishna, Arjuna said, \'Thou art Brahman
Absolute.\' Sri Krishna replied, \'Follow Me, and you will know whether
or not I am Brahman Absolute.\' So saying, Sri Krishna led Arjuna to a
certain place and asked him what he saw there. \'I see a huge tree,\'
said Arjuna, \'and on it I notice fruits hanging like clusters of
blackberries.\' Then Krishna said to Arjuna, \'Come nearer and you will
find that these are not clusters of blackberries, but clusters of
innumerable Krishnas like Me, hanging from the tree.\' In other words,
Divine Incarnations without number appear and disappear on the tree of
the Absolute Brahman.</p>
<p>\"Kavirdas was strongly inclined to the formless God. At the mention of
Krishna\'s name he would say: \'Why should I worship Him? The gopis
would clap their hands while He performed a monkey dance.\' (With a
smile) But I accept God with form when I am in the company of people who
believe in that ideal, and I also agree with those who believe in the
formless God.\"</p>
<p>M. (smiling): \"You are as infinite as He of whom we have been talking.
Truly, no one can fathom your depth.\"</p>
<p>MASTER (smiling): \"Ah! I see you have found it out. Let me tell you one
thing. One should follow various paths. One should practise each creed
for a time. In a game of satrancha a piece can\'t reach the centre
square until it completes the circle; but once in the square it can\'t
be overtaken by any other piece.\"</p>
<p>M: \"That is true, sir.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"There are two classes of. yogis: the bahudakas and the
kutichakas. The bahudakas roam about visiting various holy places and
have not yet found peace of mind. But the kutichakas, having visited all
the sacred places, have quieted their minds. Feeling serene and
peaceful, they settle down in one place and no longer move about. In
that one place they are happy; they don\'t feel the need of going to any
sacred place. If one of them ever visits a place of pilgrimage, it is
only for the purpose of new inspiration.</p>
<p>\"I had to practise each religion for a time - Hinduism, Islam,
Christianity. Furthermore, I followed the paths of the Saktas,
Vaishnavas, and Vedantists. I realized that there is only one God toward
whom all are travelling; but the paths are different.</p>
<p>\"While visiting the holy places, I would sometimes suffer great agony.
Once I went with Mathur to Raja Babu\'s drawing-room in Benares. I found
that they talked there only of worldly matters - money, real estate, and
the like. At this I burst into tears. I said to the Divine Mother,
weeping: \'Mother! Where hast Thou brought me? I was much better off at
Dakshineswar.\' In Allahabad I noticed the same things that I saw
elsewhere - the same ponds, the same grass, the same trees, the same
tamarind-leaves.</p>
<p><strong>Master\'s ecstasy at Vrindāvan</strong></p>
<p>\"But one undoubtedly finds inspiration in a holy place. I accompanied
Mathur Babu to Vrindāvan. Hriday and the ladies of Mathur\'s family were
in our party. No sooner did I see the Kaliyadaman Ghat than a divine
emotion surged up within me. I was completely overwhelmed. Hriday used
to bathe me there as if I were a small child.</p>
<p>\"In the dusk I would walk on the bank of the Jamuna when the cattle
returned along the sandy banks from their pastures. At the very sight of
those cows the thought of Krishna would flash in my mind. I would run
along like a madman, crying: \'Oh, where is Krishna? Where is my
Krishna?\'</p>
<p>\"I went to Syamakunda and Radhakunda in a palanquin and got out to
visit the holy Mount Govardhan. At the very sight of the mount I was
overpowered with divine emotion and ran to the top. I lost all
consciousness of the world around me. The residents of the place helped
me to come down. On my way to the sacred pools of Syamakunda and
Radhakunda, when I saw the meadows, the trees, the shrubs, the birds,
and the deer, I was overcome with ecstasy. My clothes became wet with
tears. I said: \'O Krishna! Everything here is as it was in the olden
days. You alone are absent.\' Seated inside the palanquin I lost all
power of speech. Hriday followed the palanquin. He had warned the
bearers to be careful about me.</p>
<p>\"Gangamayi became very fond of me in Vrindāvan. She was an old woman
who lived all alone in a hut near the Nidhuvan. Referring to my
spiritual condition and ecstasy, she said, \'He is the very embodiment
of Radha.\' She addressed me as \'Dulali\'. When with her, I used to
forget my food and drink, my bath, and all thought of going home. On
some days Hriday used to bring food from home and feed me. Gangamayi
also would serve me with food prepared by her own hands.</p>
<p>\"Gangamayi used to experience trances. At such times a great crowd
would come to see her. One day, in a state of ecstasy, she climbed on
Hriday\'s shoulders.</p>
<p>\"I didn\'t want to leave her and return to Calcutta. Everything was
arranged for me to stay with her. I was to eat double-boiled rice, and
we were to have our beds on either side of the cottage. All the
arrangements had been made, when Hriday said: \'You have such a weak
stomach. Who will look after you?\' \'Why,\' said Gangamayi, \'I shall
look after him. I\'ll nurse him.\' As Hriday dragged me by one hand and
she by the other, I remembered my mother, who was then living alone here
in the nahabat of temple garden. I found it impossible to stay away from
her, and said to Gangamayi, \'No, I must go.\' I loved the atmosphere of
Vrindāvan.\"</p>
<p>About eleven o\'clock the Master took his meal, the offerings from
temple of Kāli. After taking his noonday rest he resumed his
conversation with the devotees. Every now and then he uttered the holy
word \"Om\" or repeated the sacred names of the deities.</p>
<p>After sunset the evening worship was performed in the temples. Since it
was the day of Vijaya, the devotees first saluted the Divine Mother and
then took the dust of the Master\'s feet.</p>
<p><strong>Tuesday, October 24,1882</strong></p>
<p>It was three or four o\'clock in the afternoon. The Master was standing
near the shelf where the food was kept, when Balaram and M. arrived from
Calcutta and saluted him. Sri Ramakrishna said to them with a smile: \"I
was going to take some sweets from the shelf, but no sooner did I put my
hand on them than a lizard dropped on my body. At once I removed my
hand. (All laugh.)</p>
<p>\"Oh, yes! One should observe all these things. You see, Rakhal is ill,
and my limbs ache too. Do you know what\'s the matter? This morning as I
was leaving my bed I saw a certain person, whom I took for Rakhal. (All
laugh.) Oh, yes! Physical features should be studied. The other day
Narendra brought one of his friends, a man with only one good eye,
though the other eye was not totally blind. I said to myself, \'What is
this trouble that Narendra has brought with him?\'</p>
<p>\"A certain person comes here, but I can\'t eat any food that he brings.
He works in an office at a salary of twenty rupees and earns another
twenty by writing false bills. I can\'t utter a word in his presence,
because he tells lies. Sometimes he stays here two or three days without
going to his office. Can you guess his purpose? It is that I should
recommend him to someone for a job somewhere else.</p>
<p>\"Balaram comes from a family of devout Vaishnavas. His father, now an
old man, is a pious devotee. He has a tuft of hair on his head, a rosary
of tulsi beads round his neck, and a string of beads in his hand. He
devotes his time to the repetition of God\'s name. He owns much property
in Orissa and has built temples to Radha-Krishna in Kothar, Vrindāvan,
and other places, establishing free guest-houses as well.</p>
<p>(To Balaram) \"A certain person came here the other day. I understand he
is the slave of that black hag of a wife. Why is it that people do not
see God? It is because of the barrier of \'woman and gold\'. How
impudent he was to say to you the other day, \'A paramahamsa came to my
father, who fed him with chicken curry!\'</p>
<p>\"In my present of my mind I can eat a little fish soup if it has been
offered to the Divine Mother beforehand. I can\'t eat any meat, even if
it is offered to the Divine Mother; but I taste it with the end of my
finger lest She should be angry. (Laughter.)</p>
<p>\"Well, can you explain this state of my mind? Once I was going from
Burdwan to Kamarpukur in a bullock-cart, when a great storm arose. Some
people gathered near the cart. My companions said they were robbers. So
I began to repeat the names of God, calling sometimes on Kāli, sometimes
on Rama, sometimes on Hanuman. What do you think of that?\"</p>
<p>Was the Master hinting that God is one but is addressed differently by
different sects?</p>
<p>MASTER (to Balaram): \"Maya is nothing but \'woman and gold\'. A man
living in its midst gradually loses his spiritual alertness. He thinks
all is well with him. The scavenger carries a tub of night-soil on his
head, and in course of time loses his repulsion to it. One gradually
acquires love of God through the practice of chanting God\'s name and
glories. (To M.) One should not be ashamed of chanting God\'s holy name.
As the saying goes, \'One does not succeed so long as one has these
three: shame, hatred, and fear.\'</p>
<p>\"At Kamarpukur they sing kirtan very well. The devotional music is sung
to the accompaniment of drums.</p>
<p>(To Balaram) \"Have you installed any image at Vrindāvan?\"</p>
<p>BALARAM: \"Yes, sir. We have a grove where Krishna is worshipped.\"</p>
