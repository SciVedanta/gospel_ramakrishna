<p>THE MASTER WITH THE BRAHMO DEVOTEES (I)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>October 28, 1882</p>
</blockquote>
<p>IT WAS SATURDAY. The semi-annual Brahmo festival, celebrated each autumn
and spring, was being held in Benimadhav Pal\'s beautiful garden house
at Sinthi, about three miles north of Calcutta. The house stood in a
secluded place suited for contemplation. Trees laden with flowers,
artificial lakes with grassy banks, and green arbours enhanced the
beauty of the grounds. Just as the fleecy clouds were turning gold in
the light of the setting sun, the Master arrived.</p>
<p>Many devotees had attended the morning devotions, and in the afternoon
people from Calcutta and the neighbouring villages joined them.
Shivanath, the great Brahmo devotee whom the Master loved dearly, was
one of the large gathering of members of the Brahmo Samaj who had been
eagerly awaiting Sri Ramakrishna\'s arrival.</p>
<p>When the carriage bringing the Master and a few devotees reached the
garden house, the assembly stood up respectfully to receive him. There
was a sudden silence, like that which comes when the curtain in a
theatre is about to be rung up. People who had been conversing with one
another now fixed their attention on the Master\'s serene face, eager
not to lose one word that might fall from his lips.</p>
<p><strong>Master\'s joy on seeing Shivanāth</strong></p>
<p>At the sight of Shivanath the Master cried out joyously: \"Ah! Here is
Shivanath! You see, you are a devotee of God. The very sight of you
gladdens my heart. One hemp-smoker feels very happy to meet another.
Very often they embrace each other in an exuberance of joy.\"</p>
<p>The devotees burst out laughing.</p>
<p><strong>Worldly people\'s indifference to spiritual life</strong></p>
<p>MASTER: \"Many people visit the temple garden at Dakshineswar. If I see
some among the visitors indifferent to God, I say to them, \'You had
better sit over there.\' Or sometimes I say, \'Go and see the beautiful
buildings.\' (Laughter.)</p>
<p>\"Sometimes I find that the devotees of God are accompanied by worthless
people. Their companions are immersed in gross worldliness and don\'t
enjoy spiritual talk at all. Since the devotees keep on, for a long
time, talking with me about God, the others become restless. Finding it
impossible to sit there any longer, they whisper to their devotee
friends: \'When shall we be going? How long will you stay here?\' The
devotees say: \'Wait a bit. We shall go after a little while.\' Then the
worldly people say in a disgusted tone: \'Well, then, you can talk. We
shall wait for you in the boat.\' (All laugh.)</p>
<p><strong>Power of God\'s name</strong></p>
<p>\"Worldly people will never listen to you if you ask them to renounce
everything and devote themselves whole-heartedly to God. Therefore
Chaitanya and Nitai, after some deliberation, made an arrangement to
attract the worldly. They would say to such persons, \'Come, repeat the
name of Hari, and you shall have a delicious soup of magur fish and the
embrace of a young woman.\' Many people, attracted by the fish and the
woman, would chant the name of God. After tasting a little of the nectar
of God\'s hallowed name, they would soon realize that the \'fish soup\'
really meant the tears they shed for love of God, while the \'young
woman\' signified the earth. The embrace of the woman meant rolling on
the ground in the rapture of divine love.</p>
<p>\"Nitai would employ any means to make people repeat Hari\'s name.
Chaitanya said: \'The name of God has very great sanctity. It may not
produce an immediate result, but one day it must bear fruit. It is like
a seed</p>
<p>that has been left on the cornice of a building. After many days the
house crumbles, and the seed falls on the earth, germinates, and at last
bears fruit.\'</p>
<p><strong>Three classes of devotees</strong></p>
<p>\"As worldly people are endowed with sattva, rajas, and tamas, so also
is bakti characterized by the three gunas.</p>
<p>\"Do you know what a worldly person endowed with sattva is like? Perhaps
his house is in a dilapidated condition here and there. He doesn\'t care
to repair it. The worship hall may be strewn with pigeon droppings and
the courtyard covered with moss, but he pays no attention to these
things. The furniture of the house may be old; he doesn\'t think of
polishing it and making it look neat. He doesn\'t care for dress at all;
anything is good enough for him. But the man himself is very gentle,
quiet, kind, and humble; he doesn\'t injure anyone.</p>
<p>\"Again, among the worldly there are people with the traits of rajas.
Such a man has a watch and chain, and two or three rings on his fingers.
The furniture of his house is all spick and span. On the walls hang
portraits of the Queen, the Prince of Wales, and other prominent people;
the building is whitewashed and spotlessly clean. His wardrobe is filled
with a large assortment of clothes; even the servants have their livery,
and all that.</p>
<p>\"The traits of a worldly man endowed with tamas are sleep, lust, anger,
egotism, and the like.</p>
<p><strong>Three kinds of bhakti</strong></p>
<p>\"Similarly, bhakti, devotion, has its sattva. A devotee who possesses
it meditates on God in absolute secret, perhaps inside his mosquito net.
Others think he is asleep. Since he is late in getting up, they think
perhaps he has not slept well during the night. His love for the body
goes only as far as appeasing his hunger, and that only by means of rice
and simple greens. There is no elaborate arrangement about his meals, no
luxury in clothes, and no display of furniture. Besides, such a devotee
never flatters anybody for money.</p>
<p>\"An aspirant possessed of rajasic bhakti puts a tilak on his forehead
and a necklace of holy rudraksha beads, interspersed with gold ones,
around his neck. (All laugh.) At worship he wears a silk cloth.</p>
<p>\"A man endowed with tamasic bhakti has burning faith. Such a devotee
literally extorts boons from God, even as a robber falls upon a man and
plunders his money. \'Bind! Beat! Kill!\'-that is his way, the way of
the dacoits.\"</p>
<p><strong>Utilizing <em>Tamas</em> for spiritual welfare</strong></p>
<p>Saying this, the Master began to sing in a voice sweet with rapturous
love, his eyes turned upward:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Why should I go to Ganga or Gaya, to Kasi, Kanchi, or Prabhas, So
long as I can breathe my last with Kāli\'s name upon my lips? What
need of rituals has a man, what need of devotions any more, If he
repeats the Mother\'s name at the three holy hours? Rituals may pursue
him close, but never can they overtake him.</em></p>
<p><em>Charity, vows, and giving of gifts do not appeal to Madan\'s mind;</em></p>
<p><em>The Blissful Mother\'s Lotus Feet are his whole prayer and
sacrifice.</em></p>
<p><em>Who could ever have conceived the power Her name possesses?</em></p>
<p><em>Śiva Himself, the God of Gods, sings Her praise with His five
mouths!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Master was beside himself with love for the Divine Mother. He sang
with fiery enthusiasm:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>If only I can pass away repeating Durga\'s name,</em></p>
<p><em>How canst Thou then, O Blessed One,</em></p>
<p><em>Withhold from me deliverance,</em></p>
<p><em>Wretched though I may be? . . .</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then he said, \"One must take the firm attitude: \'What? I have chanted
the Mother\'s name. How can I be a sinner any more? I am Her child, heir
to Her powers and glories.\'</p>
<p>\"If you can give a spiritual turn to your tamas, you can realize God
with its help. Force your demands on God. He is by no means a stranger
to you. He is indeed your very own.</p>
<p><strong>Illustration of physicians</strong></p>
<p>\"Again, you see, the quality of tamas can be used for the welfare of
others. There are three classes of physicians: superior, mediocre, and
inferior. The physician who feels the patient\'s pulse and just says to
him, \'Take the medicine regularly\' belongs to the inferior class. He
doesn\'t care to inquire whether or not the patient has actually taken
the medicine. The mediocre physician is he who in various ways persuades
the patient to take the medicine, and says to him sweetly: \'My good
man, how will you be cured unless you use the medicine? Take this
medicine. I have made it for you myself.\' But he who, finding the
patient stubbornly refusing to take the medicine, forces it down his
throat, going so far as to put his knee on the patient\'s chest, is the
best physician. This is the manifestation of the tamas of the physician.
It doesn\'t injure the patient; on the contrary, it does him good.</p>
<p><strong>Three types of gurus</strong></p>
<p>\"Like the physicians, there are three types of religious teachers. The
inferior teacher only gives instruction to the disciples but makes no
inquiries about their progress. The mediocre teacher, for the good of
the student, makes repeated efforts to bring the instruction home to
him, begs him to assimilate it, and shows him love in many other ways.
But there is a type of teacher who goes to the length of using force
when he finds the student persistently unyielding; I call him the best
teacher.\"</p>
<p><strong>No finality about God\'s nature</strong></p>
<p>A BRAHMO DEVOTEE: \"Sir, has God forms or has He none?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"No one can say with finality that God is only \'this\' and
nothing else. He is formless, and again He has forms. For the bhakta He
assumes forms. But He is formless for the jnani, that is, for him who
looks on the world as a mere dream. The bhakta feels that he is one
entity and the world another. Therefore God reveals Himself to him as a
Person. But the jnani-the Vedantist, for instance-always reasons,
applying the process of \'Not this, not this\'. Through this
discrimination he realizes, by his inner perception, that the ego and
the universe are both illusory, like a dream. Then the jnani realizes
Brahman in his own consciousness. He cannot describe what Brahman is.</p>
<p>\"Do you know what I mean? Think of Brahman, Existence-Knowledge-Bliss
Absolute, as a shoreless ocean. Through the cooling influence, as it
were, of the bhakta\'s love, the water has frozen at places into blocks
of ice. In other words, God now and then assumes various forms for His
lovers and reveals Himself to them as a Person. But with the rising of
the sun of Knowledge, the blocks of ice melt. Then one doesn\'t feel any
more that God is a Person, nor does one see God\'s forms. What He is
cannot be described. Who will describe Him? He who would do so
disappears. He cannot find his \'I\' any more.</p>
<p><strong>Illusoriness of \"I\"</strong></p>
<p>\"If one analyses oneself, one doesn\'t find any such thing as \'I\'.
Take an onion, for instance. First of all you peel off the red outer
skin; then you find thick white skins. Peel these off one after the
other, and you won\'t find anything inside.</p>
<p>\"In that state a man no longer finds the existence of his ego. And who
is there left to seek it? Who can describe how he feels in that state-in
his own Pure Consciousness-about the real nature of Brahman? Once a salt
doll went to measure the depth of the ocean. No sooner was it in the
water than it melted. Now who was to tell the depth?</p>
<p><strong>Sign of Perfect Knowledge</strong></p>
<p>\"There is a sign of Perfect Knowledge. Man becomes silent when It is
attained. Then the \'I\', which may be likened to the salt doll, melts
in the Ocean of Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute and becomes one with
It. Not the slightest trace of distinction is left.</p>
<p>\"As long as his self-analysis is not complete, man argues with much
ado. But he becomes silent when he completes it. When the empty pitcher
has been filled with water, when the water inside the pitcher becomes
one with the water of the lake outside, no more sound is heard. Sound
comes from the pitcher as long as the pitcher is not filled with water.</p>
<p>\"People used to say in olden days that no boat returns after having
once entered the \'black waters\' of the ocean.</p>
<p>\"All trouble and botheration come to an end when the \'I\' dies. You
may indulge in thousands of reasoning, but still the \'I\' doesn\'t
disappear. For people like you and me, it is good to have the feeling,
\'I am a lover of God.\'</p>
<p><strong>Personal God for devotees</strong></p>
<p>\"The Saguna Brahman is meant for the bhaktas. In other words, a bhakta
believes that God has attributes and reveals Himself to men as a Person,
assuming forms. It is He who listens to our prayers. The prayers that
you utter are directed to Him alone. You are bhaktas, not jnanis or
Vedantists. It doesn\'t matter whether you accept God with form or not.
It is enough to feel that God is a Person who listens to our prayers,
who creates, preserves, and destroys the universe, and who is endowed
with infinite power.</p>
<p>\"It is easier to attain God by following the path of devotion.\"</p>
<p>BRAHMO DEVOTEE: \"Sir, is it possible for one to see God? If so, why
can\'t we see Him?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Yes, He can surely be seen. One can see His forms, and His
formless aspect as well. How can I explain that to you?\"</p>
<p><strong>Intense longing enables one to see God</strong></p>
<p>BRAHMO DEVOTEE: \"What are the means by which one can see God?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Can you weep for Him with intense longing of heart? Men shed a
jugful of tears for the sake of their children, for their wives, or for
money. But who weeps for God? So long as the child remains engrossed
with its toys, the mother looks after her cooking and other household
duties. But when the child no longer relishes the toys, it throws them
aside and yells for its mother. Then the mother takes the rice-pot down
from the hearth, runs in haste, and takes the child in her arms.\"</p>
<p><strong>Why so much controversy about God?</strong></p>
<p>BRAHMO DEVOTEE: \"Sir, why are there so many different opinions about
the nature of God? Some say that God has form, while others say that He
is formless. Again, those who speak of God with form tell us about His
different forms. Why all this controversy?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"A devotee thinks of God as he sees Him. In reality there is no
confusion about God. God explains all this to the devotee if the devotee
only realizes Him somehow. You haven\'t set your foot in that direction.
How can you expect to know all about God?</p>
<p><strong>Parable of the chameleon</strong></p>
<p>\"Listen to a story. Once a man entered a wood and saw a small animal on
a tree. He came back and told another man that he had seen a creature of
a beautiful red colour on a certain tree. The second man replied: \'When
I went into the wood, I also saw that animal. But why do you call it
red? It is green.\' Another man who was present contradicted them both
and insisted that it was yellow. Presently others arrived and contended
that it was grey, violet, blue, and so forth and so on. At last they
started quarrelling among themselves. To</p>
<p>settle the dispute they all went to the tree. They saw a man sitting
under it. On being asked, he replied: \'Yes, I live under this tree and
I know the animal very well. All your descriptions are true. Sometimes
it appears red, sometimes yellow, and at other times blue, violet, grey,
and so forth. It is a chameleon. And sometimes it has no colour at all.
Now it has a colour, and now it has none.\'</p>
<p>\"In like manner, one who constantly thinks of God can know His real
nature; he alone knows that God reveals Himself to seekers in various
forms and aspects. God has attributes; then again He has none. Only the
man who lives under the tree knows that the chameleon can appear in
various colours, and he knows, further, that the animal at times has no
colour at all. It is the others who suffer from the agony of futile
argument.</p>
<p>\"Kabir used to say, \'The formless Absolute is my Father, and God with
form is my Mother.\'</p>
<p>\"God reveals Himself in the form which His devotee loves most. His love
for the devotee knows no bounds. It is written in the Purana that God
assumed the form of Rama for His heroic devotee, Hanuman.</p>
<p><strong>Vedantic Non-dualism</strong></p>
<p>\"The forms and aspects of God disappear when one discriminates in
accordance with the Vedanta philosophy. The ultimate conclusion of such
discrimination is that Brahman alone is real and this world of names and
forms illusory. It is possible for a man to see the forms of God, or to
think of Him as a Person, only so long as he is conscious that he is a
devotee. From the standpoint of discrimination this \'ego of a devotee\'
keeps him a little away from God.</p>
<p>\"Do you know why images of Krishna or Kāli are three and a half cubits
high? Because of distance. Again, on account of distance the sun appears
to be small. But if you go near it you will find the sun so big that you
won\'t be able to comprehend it. Why have images of Krishna and Kāli a
dark-blue colour? That too is on account of distance, like the water of
a lake, which appears green, blue, or black from a distance. Go near,
take the water in the palm of your hand, and you will find that it has
no colour. The sky also appears blue from a distance. Go near and you
will see that it has no colour at all.</p>
<p>\"Therefore I say that in the light of Vedantic reasoning Brahman has no
attributes. The real nature of Brahman cannot be described. But so long
as your individuality is real, the world also is real, and equally real
are the different forms of God and the feeling that God is a Person.</p>
<p>\"Yours is the path of bhakti. That is very good; it is an easy path.
Who can fully know the infinite God? and what need is there of knowing
the Infinite? Having attained this rare human birth, my supreme need is
to develop love for the Lotus Feet of God.</p>
<p>\"If a jug of water is enough to remove my thirst, why should I measure
the quantity of water in a lake? I become drunk on even half a bottle of
wine-what is the use of my calculating the quantity of liquor in the
tavern? What need is there of knowing the Infinite?</p>
<p>\"The various states of mind of the Brahmajnani are described in the
Vedas. The path of knowledge is extremely difficult. One cannot obtain
jnāna if one has the least trace of worldliness and the slightest
attachment to \'woman and gold\'. This is not the path for the Kaliyuga.</p>
<p><strong>Seven planes of the mind</strong></p>
<p>\"The Vedas speak of seven planes where the mind dwells. When the mind
is immersed in worldliness it dwells in the three lower planes- at the
naval, the organ of generation, and the organ of evacuation. In that
state the mind loses all its higher visions-it broods only on \'woman
and gold\'. The fourth plane of the mind is at the heart. When the mind
dwells there, one has the first glimpse of spiritual consciousness. One
sees light all around. Such a man, perceiving the divine light, becomes
speechless with wonder and says: \'Ah! What is this? What is this?\' His
mind does not go downward to the objects of the world.</p>
<p>\"The fifth plane of the mind is at the throat. When the mind reaches
this, the aspirant becomes free from all</p>
<p>ignorance and illusion. He does not enjoy talking or hearing about
anything but God. If people talk about worldly things, he leaves the
place at once.</p>
<p>\"The sixth plane is at the forehead. When the mind reaches it, the
aspirant sees the form of God day and night. But even then a little
trace of ego remains. At the sight of that incomparable beauty of God\'s
form, one becomes intoxicated and rushes forth to touch and embrace it.
But one doesn\'t succeed. It is like the light inside a lantern. One
feels as if one could touch the light, but one cannot on account of the
pane of glass.</p>
<p>\"In the top of the head is the seventh plane. When the mind rises
there, one goes into samādhi. Then the Brahmajnani directly perceives
Brahman. But in that state his body does not last many days. He remains
unconscious of the outer world. If milk is poured into his mouth, it
runs out. Dwelling on this plane of consciousness, he gives up his body
in twenty-one days. That is the condition of the Brahmajnani. But yours
is the path of devotion. That is a very good and easy path.</p>
<p>\"Once a man said to me, \'Sir, can you teach me quickly the thing you
call samādhi?\' (All laugh.)</p>
<p><strong>Duties drop away with deepening of spiritual mood</strong></p>
<p>\"After a man has attained samādhi all his actions drop away. All
devotional activities, such as worship, japa, and the like, as well as
all worldly duties, cease to exist for such a person. At the beginning
there is much ado about work. As a man makes progress toward God, the
outer display of his work becomes less and less-so much so that he
cannot even sing the name and glories of God. (To Shivanath) As long as
you were not here at the meeting, people talked a great deal about you
and discussed your virtues. But no sooner did you arrive here than all
that stopped. Now the very sight of you makes everyone happy. People now
simply say, \'Ah! Here is Shivanath Babu.\' All other talk about you has
stopped.</p>
<p><strong>What happens after samādhi</strong></p>
<p>\"After attaining samādhi, I once went to the Ganges to perform tarpan.
But as I took water in the palm of my hand, it trickled down through my
fingers. Weeping, I said to Haladhāri, \'Cousin, what is this?\'
Haladhāri replied, \'It is called galitahasta in the holy books.\' After
the vision of God, such duties as the performance of tarpan drop away.</p>
<p>\"In the kirtan the devotee first sings, \'Nitai amar mata hati.\' As
the devotional mood deepens, he simply sings, \'Hati! Hati!\' Next, all
he can sing is \'Hati\'. And last of all he simply sings, \'Ha!\' and
goes into samādhi. The man who has been singing all the while then
becomes speechless.</p>
<p>\"Again, at a feast given to the brahmins one at first hears much noise
of talking. When the guests sit on the floor with leaf-plates in front
of them, much of the noise ceases. Then one hears only the cry, \'Bring
some luchi!\'</p>
<p>As they partake of the luchi and other dishes, three quarters of the
noise subsides. When the curd, the last course, appears, one hears only
the sound \'soop, soop\' as the guests eat the curd with their fingers.
Then there is practically no noise. Afterwards all retire to sleep, and
absolute silence reigns.</p>
<p>\"Therefore I say, at the beginning of religious life a man makes much
ado about work, but as his mind dives deeper into God, he becomes less
active. Last of all comes the renunciation of work, followed by samādhi.</p>
<p>\"Generally the body does not remain alive after the attainment of
samādhi. The only exceptions are such sages as Narada, who keep their
bodies alive in order to bring spiritual light to others. It is also
true of Divine Incarnations, like Chaitanya. After the well is dug, one
generally throws away the spade and the basket. But some keep them in
order to help their neighbours. The great souls who retain their bodies
after samādhi feel compassion for the suffering of others. They are not
so selfish as to be satisfied with their own illumination. You are well
aware of the nature of selfish people. If you ask them to spit at a
particular place, they won\'t, lest it should do you good. If you ask
them to bring a sweetmeat worth a cent from the store, they will perhaps
lick it on the way back. (All laugh.)</p>
<p>\"But the manifestations of Divine Power are different in different
beings. Ordinary souls are afraid to teach others. A piece of worthless
timber may itself somehow float across the water, but it sinks even
under the weight of a bird. Sages like Narada are like a heavy log of
wood, which not only floats on the water but also can carry men, cows,
and even elephants.</p>
<p>(To Shivanath and the other Brahmo devotees) \"Can you tell me why you
dwell so much on the powers and glories of God? I asked the same thing
of Keshab Sen. One day Keshab and his party came to the temple garden at
Dakshineswar. I told them I wanted to hear how they lectured. A meeting
was arranged in the paved courtyard above the bathing-ghat on the
Ganges, where Keshab gave a talk. He spoke very well. I went into a
trance. After the lecture I said to Keshab, \'Why do you so often say
such things as: \"O God, what beautiful flowers Thou hast made! O God,
Thou hast created the heavens, the stars, and the ocean!\" and so on?\'
Those who love splendour themselves are fond of dwelling on God\'s
splendour.</p>
<p>\"Once a thief stole the jewels from the images in the temple of
Radhakanta. Mathur Babu entered the temple and said to the Deity: \'What
a shame, O God! You couldn\'t save Your own ornaments.\' \'The idea!\' I
said to Mathur. \'Does He who has Lakshmi for His handmaid and attendant
ever lack any splendour? Those jewels may be precious to you, but to God
they are no better than lumps of clay. Shame on you! You shouldn\'t have
spoken so meanly. \'What riches can you give to God to magnify His
glory?\'</p>
<p>\"Therefore I say, a man seeks the person in whom he finds joy. What
need has he to ask where that person lives, the number of his houses,
gardens, relatives, and servants, or the amount of his wealth? I forget
everything when I see Narendra. Never, even unwittingly, have I asked
him where he lived, what his father\'s profession was, or the number of
his brothers.</p>
<p>\"Dive deep in the sweetness of God\'s Bliss. What need have we of His
infinite creation and unlimited glory?\"</p>
<p>The Master sang:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Dive deep, O mind, dive deep in the Ocean of God\'s Beauty; If you
descend to the uttermost depths, There you will find the gem of Love.</em></p>
<p><em>Go seek, O mind, go seek Vrindāvan in your heart,</em></p>
<p><em>Where with His loving devotees</em></p>
<p><em>Sri Krishna sports eternally.</em></p>
<p><em>Light up, O mind, light up true wisdom\'s shining lamp,</em></p>
<p><em>And let it burn with steady flame</em></p>
<p><em>Unceasingly within your heart.</em></p>
<p><em>Who is it that steers your boat across the solid earth?</em></p>
<p><em>It is your guru, says Kubir;</em></p>
<p><em>Meditate on his holy feet.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna continued: \"It is also true that after the vision of
God the devotee desires to witness His lila. After the destruction of
Ravana at Rama\'s hands, Nikasha, Ravana\'s mother, began to run away
for fear of her life. Lakshmana said to Rama: \'Revered Brother, please
explain this strange thing to me. This Nikasha is an old woman who has
suffered a great deal from the loss of her many sons, and yet she is so
afraid of losing her own life that she is taking to her heels!\' Rama
bade her come near, gave her assurance of safety, and asked her why she
was running away. Nikasha answered: \'O Rama, I am able to witness all
this lila of Yours because I am still alive. I want to live longer so
that I may see the many more things You will do on this earth.\' (All
laugh.)</p>
<p>(To Shivanath) \"I like to see you. How can I live unless I see
pure-souled devotees? I feel as if they had been my friends in a former
incarnation.\"</p>
<p><strong>Reincarnation of soul &amp; Inscrutability of God\'s ways</strong></p>
<p>A BRAHMO DEVOTEE: \"Sir, do you believe in the reincarnation of the
soul?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Yes, they say there is something like that. How can we
understand the ways of God through our small intellects? Many people
have spoken about reincarnation; therefore I cannot disbelieve it. As
Bhishma lay dying on his bed of arrows, the Pandava brothers and Krishna
stood around him. They saw tears flowing from the eyes of the great
hero. Arjuna said to Krishna: \'Friend, how surprising it is! Even such
a man as our grandsire Bhishma-truthful, self-restrained, supremely
wise, and one of the eight Vasus-weeps, through maya, at the hour of
death.\' Sri Krishna asked Bhishma about it. Bhishma replied: \'O
Krishna, You know very well that this is not the cause of my grief. I am
thinking that there is no end to the Pandavas\' sufferings, though God
Himself is their charioteer.7 A thought like this makes me feel that I
have understood nothing of the ways of God, and so I weep.\' \"</p>
<p>It was about half past eight when the evening worship began in the
prayer hall. Soon the moon rose in the autumn sky and flooded the trees
and creepers of the garden with its light. After prayer the devotees
began to sing. Sri Ramakrishna was dancing, intoxicated with love of
God. The Brahmo devotees danced around him to the accompaniment of drums
and cymbals. All appeared to be in a very joyous mood. The place echoed
and re-echoed with God\'s holy name. When the music had stopped, Sri
Ramakrishna prostrated himself on the ground and, making salutations to
the Divine Mother again and again, said: \"Bhagavata-Bhakta-Bhagavan! My
salutations at the feet of the jnanis! My salutations at the feet of the
bhaktas! I salute the bhaktas who believe in God with form, and I salute
the bhaktas who believe in God without form. I salute the knowers of
Brahman of olden times. And my salutations at the feet of the modern
knowers of Brahman of the Brahmo Samaj!\"</p>
<p>Then the Master and the devotees enjoyed a supper of delicious dishes,
which Benimadhav, their host, had provided.</p>
<p><strong>Wednesday, November 15, 1882</strong></p>
<p><strong>Master at the circus</strong></p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna, accompanied by Rakhal and several other devotees, came
to Calcutta in a carriage and called for M. at the school where he was
teaching. Then they all set out for the Maidan. Sri Ramakrishna wanted
to see the Wilson Circus. As the carriage rolled along the crowded
Chitpore Road, his joy was very great. Like a little child he leaned
first out of one side of the carriage and then out of the other, talking
to himself as if addressing the passers-by. To M. he said: \"I find the
attention of the people fixed on earthly things. They are all rushing
about for the sake of their stomachs. No one is thinking of God.\"</p>
<p>They arrived at the circus. Tickets for the cheapest seats were
purchased. The devotees took the Master to a high gallery, and they all
sat on a bench. He said joyfully: \"Ha! This is a good place. I can see
the show well from here.\" There were exhibitions of various feats. A
horse raced around a circular track over which large iron rings were
hung at intervals. The circus rider, an Englishwoman, stood on one foot
on the horse\'s back, and as the horse passed under the rings, she
jumped through them, always alighting on one foot on the horse\'s back.
The horse raced around the entire circle, and the woman never missed the
horse or lost her balance.</p>
<p>When the circus was over, the Master and the devotees stood outside in
the field, near the carriage. Since it was a cold night he covered his
body with his green shawl.</p>
<p><strong>Necessity of spiritual discipline</strong></p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna said to M.: \"Did you see how that Englishwoman stood on
one foot on her horse, while it ran like lightning? How difficult a feat
that must be! She must have practised a long time. The slightest
carelessness and she would break her arms or legs; she might even be
killed. One faces the same difficulty leading the life of a householder.
A few succeed in it through the grace of God and as a result of their
spiritual practice. But most people fail. Entering the world, they
become more and more involved in it; they drown in worldliness and
suffer the agonies of death. A few only, like Janaka, have succeeded,
through the power of</p>
<p>their austerity, in leading the spiritual life as householders.
Therefore spiritual practice is extremely necessary; otherwise one
cannot rightly live in the world.\"</p>
<p>The Master got into the carriage with the devotees and went to Balaram
Bose\'s house. He was taken with his companions to the second floor. It
was evening and the lamps were lighted. The Master described the feats
he had seen at the circus. Gradually other devotees gathered, and soon
he was engaged in spiritual talk with them.</p>
<p><strong>Master on caste-system</strong></p>
<p>The conversation turned to the caste-system. Sri Ramakrishna said: \"The
caste-system can be removed by one means only, and that is the love of
God. Lovers of God do not belong to any caste. The mind, body, and soul
of a man become purified through divine love. Chaitanya and Nityananda
scattered the name of Hari to everyone, including the pariah, and
embraced them all. A brahmin without this love is no longer a brahmin.
And a pariah with the love of God is no longer a pariah. Through bhakti
an untouchable becomes pure and elevated.\"</p>
<p><strong>Entanglement of householders</strong></p>
<p>Speaking of householders entangled in worldliness, the Master said:
\"They are like the silk-worm. They can come out of the cocoon of their
worldly life if they wish. But they can\'t bear to; for they themselves
have built the cocoon with great love and care. So they die there. Or
they are like the fish in a trap. They can come out of it by the way
they entered, but they sport inside the trap with other fish and hear
the sweet sound of the murmuring water and forget everything else. They
don\'t even make an effort to free themselves from the trap. The lisping
of children is the murmur of the water; and the other fish are relatives
and friends. Only one or two make good their escape by running away.
They are the liberated souls.\"</p>
<p>The Master then sang:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>When such delusion veils the world, through Mahamaya\'s spell,</em></p>
<p><em>That Brahma is bereft of sense,</em></p>
<p><em>And Vishnu loses consciousness,</em></p>
<p><em>What hope is left for men?</em></p>
<p><em>The narrow channel first is made, and there the trap is set;</em></p>
<p><em>But open though the passage lies,</em></p>
<p><em>The fish, once safely through the gate,</em></p>
<p><em>Do not come out again.</em></p>
<p><em>The silk-worm patiently prepares its closely spun cocoon;</em></p>
<p><em>Yet even though a way leads forth,</em></p>
<p><em>Encased within its own cocoon,</em></p>
<p><em>The worm remains to die.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Master continued: \"Man may be likened to grain. He has fallen
between the millstones and is about to be crushed. Only the few grains
that stay near the peg escape. Therefore men should take refuge at the
peg, that is to say, in God. Call on Him. Sing His name. Then you will
be free. Otherwise you will be crushed by the King of Death.\"</p>
<p>The Master sang again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Mother! Mother! My boat is sinking, here in the ocean of this world;</em></p>
<p><em>Fiercely the hurricane of delusion rages on every side!</em></p>
<p><em>Clumsy is my helmsman, the mind; stubborn my six oarsmen, the
passions;</em></p>
<p><em>Into a pitiless wind</em></p>
<p><em>I sailed my boat, and now it is sinking!</em></p>
<p><em>Split is the rudder of devotion; tattered is the sail of faith;</em></p>
<p><em>Into my boat the waters are pouring! Tell me, what shall I do?</em></p>
<p><em>For with my failing eyes, alas! nothing but darkness do I see.</em></p>
<p><em>Here in the waves I will swim,</em></p>
<p><em>O Mother, and cling to the raft of Thy name!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Viswas had been sitting in the room a long time; he now left. He had
once been wealthy but had squandered everything in an immoral life.
Finally he had become indifferent to his wife and children. Referring to
Mr. Viswas, the Master said: \"He is an unfortunate wretch. A
householder has his duties to discharge, his debts to pay: his debt to
the gods, his debt to his ancestors, his debt to the rishis, and his
debt to wife and children. If a wife is chaste, then her husband should
support her; he should also bring up their children until they are of
age. Only a monk must not save; the bird and the monk do not provide for
the morrow. But even a bird provides when it has young. It brings food
in its bill for its chicks.\"</p>
<p>BALARAM: \"Mr. Viswas now wants to cultivate the company of holy
people.\"</p>
<p>MASTER (with a smile): \"A monk\'s kamandalu goes to the four principal
holy places with him, but it still tastes bitter. Likewise, it is said
that the Malaya breeze turns all trees into sandal-wood. But there are a
few exceptions, such as the cotton-tree, the Aśwattha, and the hog plum.</p>
<p>\"Some frequent the company of holy men in order to smoke hemp. Many
monks smoke it, and these householders stay with them, prepare the hemp,
and partake of the prasad.\"</p>
<p><strong>Thursday, November 16, 1882</strong></p>
<p>The Master had come to Calcutta. In the evening he went to the house of
Rajmohan, a member of the Brahmo Samaj, where Narendra and some of his
young friends used to meet and worship according to the Brahmo
ceremonies. Sri Ramakrishna wanted to see their worship. He was
accompanied by M. and a few other devotees.</p>
<p>The Master was very happy to see Narendra and expressed a desire to
watch the young men at their worship. Narendra sang and then the worship
began. One of the young men conducted it. He prayed, \"O Lord, may we
give up everything and be absorbed in Thee!\" Possibly the youth was
inspired by the Master\'s presence and so talked of utter renunciation.
Sri Ramakrishna remarked in a whisper, \"Much likelihood there is of
that!\" Rajmohan served the Master with refreshments.</p>
<p><strong>Sunday, November 19, 1882</strong></p>
<p>It was the auspicious occasion of the Jagaddhatri Puja, the festival of
the Divine Mother. Sri Ramakrishna was invited to Surendra\'s house in
Calcutta; but first he went to the house of Manomohan in the
neighbourhood.</p>
<p>The Master was seated in Manomohan\'s parlour. He said: \"God very</p>
<p>much relishes the bhakti of the poor and the lowly, just as the cow
relishes fodder mixed with oil-cake. King Duryodhana showed Krishna the
splendour of his wealth and riches, but Krishna accepted the hospitality
of the poor Vidura. God is fond of His devotees. He runs after the
devotee as the cow after the calf.\"</p>
<p>The Master sang:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>And, for that love, the mighty yogis practise yoga from age to age;</em></p>
<p><em>When love awakes, the Lord, like a magnet, draws to Him the soul.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then he said: \"Chaitanya used to shed tears of joy at the very mention
of Krishna\'s name. God alone is the real Substance; all else is
illusory. Man can realize God if he wants to, but he madly craves the
enjoyment of \'woman and gold\'. The snake has a precious stone in its
head, but it is perfectly satisfied to eat a mere frog.</p>
<p>\"Bhakti is the one essential thing. Who can ever know God through
reasoning? I want love of God. What do I care about knowing His infinite
glories? One bottle of wine makes me drunk. What do I care about knowing
how many gallons there are in the grog-shop? One jar of water is enough
to quench my thirst. I don\'t need to</p>
<p>know the amount of water there is on earth.\"</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna arrived at Surendra\'s house. Many devotees had
assembled there, including Surendra\'s elder brother, who was a judge.</p>
<p><strong>Futility of reasoning</strong></p>
<p>MASTER (To Surendra\'s brother): \"You are a judge. That is very good.
But remember, everything happens through God\'s power. It is He who has
given you your high position; that is how you became a judge. People
think it is they who are great. The water from the roof flows through a
spout that is shaped like a lion\'s head. It looks as if the lion were
bringing the water out through its mouth. But look at the source of the
water! A cloud gathers in the sky and rain falls on the roof; then the
water flows through the pipe and at last comes out through the spout.\"</p>
<p>SURENDRA\'S BROTHER: \"The Brahmo Samaj preaches the freedom of women
and the abolition of the caste-system. What do you think about these
matters?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Men feel that way when they are just beginning to develop
spiritual yearning. A storm raises clouds of dust, and one cannot
distinguish between the different trees-the mango, the hog plum, and the
tamarind. But after the storm blows over, one sees clearly. After the
first storm of divine passion is quelled, one gradually understands that
God alone is the Highest Good, the Eternal Substance, and that all else
is transitory. One cannot grasp this without tapasya and the company of
holy men. What is the use of merely reciting the written parts for the
drum? It is very difficult to put them into practice on the instrument.
What can be accomplished by a mere lecture? It is austerity that is
necessary. By that alone can one comprehend.</p>
<p>\"You asked about caste distinctions. There is only one way to remove
them, and that is by love of God. Lovers of God have no caste. Through
this divine love the untouchable becomes pure, the pariah no longer
remains a pariah. Chaitanya embraced all, including the pariahs.</p>
<p>\"The members of the Brahmo Samaj sing the name of Hari. That is very
good. Through earnest prayer one receives the grace of God and realizes
Him. God can be realized by means of all paths. The same God is invoked
by different names.\"</p>
<p><strong>Master on Theosophy</strong></p>
<p>SURENDRA\'S BROTHER: \"Sir, what do you think of Theosophy?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"I have heard that man can acquire superhuman powers through it
and perform miracles. I saw a man who had brought a ghost under control.
The ghost used to procure various things for his master. What shall I do
with superhuman powers? Can one realize God through them? If God is not
realized then everything becomes false.\"</p>
<p><strong>November 1882</strong></p>
<p>It was about four o\'clock in the afternoon when Sri Ramakrishna arrived
in Calcutta to attend the annual festival of the Brahmo Samaj, which was
to be celebrated at Manilal Mallick\'s house. Besides M. and other
devotees of the Master, Vijay Goswami and a number of Brahmos were
present. Elaborate arrangements had been made to make the occasion a
success. Vijay was to conduct the worship.</p>
<p>The kathak recited the life of Prahlada from the Purana. Its substance
was as follows: Hiranyakasipu, Prahlada\'s father, was king of the
demons. He bore great malice toward God and put his own son through
endless tortures for leading a religious life. Afflicted by his father,
Prahlada prayed to God, \"O God, please give my father holy
inclinations.\"</p>
<p>At these words the Master wept. He went into an ecstatic mood.
Afterwards he began to talk to the devotees.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Bhakti is the only essential thing. One obtains love of God by
constantly chanting His name and</p>
<p>singing His glories. Ah! What a devotee Shivanath is! He is soaked in
the love of God, like a cheese-cake in syrup.</p>
<p>\"One should not think, \'My religion alone is the right path and other
religions are false.\' God can be realized by means of all paths. It is
enough to have sincere yearning for God. Infinite are the paths and
infinite the opinions.</p>
<p><strong>The pure in heart see God</strong></p>
<p>\"Let me tell you one thing. God can be seen. The Vedas say that God is
beyond mind and speech. The meaning of this is that God is unknown to
the mind attached to worldly objects. Vaishnavcharan used to say, \'God
is known by the mind and intellect that are pure.\' Therefore it is
necessary to seek the company of holy men, practise prayer, and listen
to the instruction of the guru. These purify the mind. Then one sees
God. Dirt can be removed from water by a purifying agent. Then one sees
one\'s reflection in it. One cannot see one\'s face in a mirror if the
mirror is covered with dirt.</p>
<p>\"After the purification of the heart one obtains divine love. Then one
sees God, through His grace. One can teach others if one receives that
command from God after seeing Him. Before that one should not
\'lecture\'. There is a song that says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>You have set up no image here,</em></p>
<p><em>Within the shrine, O fool!</em></p>
<p><em>Blowing the conch, you simply make</em></p>
<p><em>Confusion worse confounded.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>\"You should first cleanse the shrine of your heart. Then you should
install the Deity and arrange worship. As yet nothing has been done.
What can you achieve by blowing the conch-shell and simply making a loud
noise? \"</p>
<p>Vijay sat on a raised stool and conducted the worship according to the
rules of the Brahmo Samaj. Afterwards he sat by the Master.</p>
<p>MASTER (to Vijay): \"Will you tell me one thing? Why did you harp so
much on sin? By repeating a hundred times, \'I am a sinner\', one verily
becomes a sinner. One should have such faith as to be able to say,
\'What? I have taken the name of God; how can I be a sinner?\' God is
our Father and Mother. Tell Him, \'O Lord, I have committed sins, but I
won\'t repeat them.\' Chant His name and purify your body and mind.
Purify your tongue by singing God\'s holy name.\"</p>
<p><strong>December 1882</strong></p>
<p>In the afternoon Sri Ramakrishna was seated on the west porch of his
room in the temple garden at Dakshineswar. Among others, Baburam,
Ramdayal, and M. were present. These three were going to spend the night
with the Master. M. intended to stay the following day also, for he was
having his Christmas holidays. Baburam had only recently begun to visit
the Master.</p>
<p>MASTER (to the devotees): \"A man becomes liberated even in this life
when he knows that God is the Doer of all things. Once Keshab came here
with Sambhu Mallick. I said to him, \'Not even a leaf moves except by
the will of God.\' Where is man\'s free will? All are under the will of
God. Nangta was a man of great knowledge, yet even he was about to drown
himself in the Ganges. He stayed here eleven months. At one time he
suffered from stomach trouble. The excruciating pain made him lose
control over himself, and he wanted to drown himself in the river. There
was a long shoal near the bathing-ghat. However far he went into the
river, he couldn\'t find water above his knees. Then he understood
everything and came back. At one time I was very ill and was about to
cut my throat with a knife. Therefore I say: \'O Mother, I am the
machine and Thou art the Operator; I am the chariot and Thou art the
Driver. I move as Thou movest me; I do as Thou makest me do.\' \"</p>
<p>The devotees sing kirtan in the Master\'s room:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Dwell, O Lord, O Lover of bhakti,</em></p>
<p><em>In the Vrindāvan of my heart,</em></p>
<p><em>And my devotion unto Thee</em></p>
<p><em>Will be Thy Radha, dearly loved;</em></p>
<p><em>My body will be Nanda\'s home,</em></p>
<p><em>My tenderness will be Yaśoda,</em></p>
<p><em>My longing for deliverance</em></p>
<p><em>Will be Thy gentle gopi maids.</em></p>
<p><em>Lift the Govardhan of my sin</em></p>
<p><em>And slay my six unyielding passions,</em></p>
<p><em>Fierce as the demons sent by Kamsa!</em></p>
<p><em>Sweetly play the flute of Thy grace,</em></p>
<p><em>Charming the milch cow of my mind;</em></p>
<p><em>Abide in the pasture of my soul.</em></p>
<p><em>Dwell by the Jamuna of my yearning,</em></p>
<p><em>Under the banyan of my hope,</em></p>
<p><em>For ever gracious to Thy servant;</em></p>
<p><em>And, if naught but the cowherds\' love</em></p>
<p><em>Can hold Thee in Vrindāvan\'s vale,</em></p>
<p><em>Then, Lord, let Dasarathi, too,</em></p>
<p><em>Become Thy cowherd and Thy slave.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again they sang:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Sing, O bird that nestles deep within my heart!</em></p>
<p><em>Sing, O bird that sits on the Kalpa-Tree of Brahman!</em></p>
<p><em>Sing God\'s everlasting praise.</em></p>
<p><em>Taste, O bird, of the four fruits of the Kalpa-Tree,</em></p>
<p><em>Dharma, artha, kama, moksha.</em></p>
<p><em>Sing, O bird, \"He alone is the Comfort of my soul!\"</em></p>
<p><em>Sing, O bird, \"He alone is my life\'s enduring Joy!\"</em></p>
<p><em>O thou wondrous bird of my life,</em></p>
<p><em>Sing aloud in my heart! Unceasingly sing, O bird!</em></p>
<p><em>Sing for evermore, even as the thirsty chatak</em></p>
<p><em>Sings for the raindrop from the cloud.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A devotee from Nandanbagan entered the room with his friends. The Master
looked at him and said, \"Everything inside him can be seen through his
eyes, as one sees the objects in a room through a glass door.\" This
devotee and his brothers always celebrated the anniversary of the Brahmo
Samaj at their house in Nandanbagan. Sri Ramakrishna had taken part in
these festivals.</p>
<p>The evening worship began in the temples. The Master was seated on the
small couch in his room, absorbed in meditation. He went into an
ecstatic mood and said a little later: \"Mother, please draw him to
Thee. He is so modest and humble! He has been visiting Thee.\" Was the
Master referring to Baburam, who later became one of his foremost
disciples?</p>
<p><strong>Why so much suffering in God\'s creation?</strong></p>
<p>The Master explained the different kinds of samādhi to the devotees. The
conversation then turned to the joy and suffering of life. Why did God
create so much suffering?</p>
<p>M: \"Once Vidyasagar said in a mood of pique: \'What is the use of
calling on God? Just think of this incident: At</p>
<p>one time Chenghiz Khan plundered a country and imprisoned many people.
The number of prisoners rose to about a hundred thousand. The commander
of his army said to him: \"Your Majesty, who will feed them? It is risky
to keep them with us. It will be equally dangerous to release them. What
shall I do?\" Chenghiz Khan said: \"That\'s true. What can be done?
Well, have them killed.\" The order was accordingly given to cut them to
pieces. Now, God saw this slaughter, didn\'t He? But He didn\'t stop it
in any way. Therefore I don\'t need God, whether He exists or not. I
don\'t derive any good from Him.\'\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Is it possible to understand God\'s action and His motive? He
creates, He preserves, and He destroys. Can we ever understand why He
destroys? I say to the Divine Mother: \'O Mother, I do not need to
understand. Please give me love for Thy Lotus Feet.\' The aim of human
life is to attain bhakti. As for other things, the Mother knows best. I
have come to the garden to eat mangoes. What is the use of my
calculating the number of trees, branches, and leaves? I only eat the
mangoes; I don\'t need to know the number of trees and leaves.\"</p>
<p>Baburam, M., and Ramdayal slept that night on the floor of the Master\'s
room.</p>
<p>It was an early hour of the morning, about two or three o\'clock. The
room was dark. Sri Ramakrishna was seated on his bed and now and then
conversed with the devotees.</p>
<p><strong>Compassion and attachment</strong></p>
<p>MASTER: \"Remember that daya, compassion, and maya, attachment, are two
different things. Attachment means the feeling of \'my-ness\' toward
one\'s relatives. It is the love one feels for one\'s parents, one\'s
brother, one\'s sister, one\'s wife and children. Compassion is the love
one feels for all beings of the world. It is an attitude of equality. If
you see anywhere an instance of compassion, as in Vidyasagar, know that
it is due to the grace of God. Through compassion one serves all beings.
Maya also comes from God. Through maya God makes one serve one\'s
relatives. But one thing should be remembered: maya keeps us in
ignorance and entangles us in the world, whereas daya makes our hearts
pure and gradually unties our bonds.</p>
<p>\"God cannot be realized without purity of heart. One receives the grace
of God by subduing the passions-lust, anger, and greed. Then one sees
God. I tried many things in order to conquer lust.</p>
<p>\"When I was ten or eleven years old and lived at Kamarpukur, I first
experienced samādhi. As I was passing through a paddy-field, I saw
something and was overwhelmed. There are certain characteristics of
God-vision. One sees light, feels joy, and experiences the upsurge of a
great current in one\'s chest, like the bursting of a rocket.\"</p>
<p>The next day Baburam and Ramdayal returned to Calcutta. M. spent the day
and the night with the Master.</p>
<p><strong>December 1882</strong></p>
<p>It was afternoon. The Master was sitting in his room at Dakshineswar
with M. and one or two other devotees. Several Marwari devotees arrived
and saluted the Master. They requested Sri Ramakrishna to give them
spiritual instruction. He smiled.</p>
<p>MASTER (to the Marwari devotees): \"You see, the feeling of \'I\' and
\'mine\' is the result of ignorance. But to say, \'O God, Thou art the
Doer; all these belong to Thee\' is the sign of Knowledge. How can you
say such a thing as \'mine\'? The superintendent of the garden says,
\'This is my garden.\' But if he is dismissed because of some
misconduct, then he does not have the courage to take away even such a
worthless thing as his mango-wood box. Anger and lust cannot be
destroyed. Turn them toward God. If you must feel desire and temptation,
then desire to realize God, feel tempted by Him. Discriminate and turn
the passions away from worldly objects. When the elephant is about to
devour a plaintain-tree in someone\'s garden, the mahut strikes it with
his iron-tipped goad.</p>
<p>\"You are merchants. You know how to improve your business gradually.
Some of you start with a castor-oil factory. After making some money at
that, you open a cloth shop. In the same way, one makes progress</p>
<p>toward God. It may be that you go into solitude, now and then, and
devote more time to prayer.</p>
<p>\"But you must remember that nothing can be achieved except in its
proper time. Some persons must pass through many experiences and perform
many worldly duties before they can turn their attention to God; so they
have to wait a long time. If an abscess is lanced before it is soft, the
result is not good; the surgeon makes the opening when it is soft and
has come to a head. Once a child said to its mother: \'Mother, I am
going to sleep now. Please wake me up when I feel the call of nature.\'
\'My child,\' said the mother, \'when it is time for that, you will wake
up yourself. I shan\'t have to wake you.\' \"</p>
<p>The Marwari devotees generally brought offerings of fruit, candy, and
other sweets for the Master. But Sri Ramakrishna could hardly eat them.
He would say: \"They earn their money by falsehood. I can\'t eat their
offerings.\" He said to the Marwaris: \"You see, one can\'t strictly
adhere to truth in business. There are ups and downs in business. Nanak
once said, \'I was about to eat the food of unholy people, when I found
it stained with blood.\' A man should offer only pure things to holy
men. He shouldn\'t give them food earned by dishonest means. God is
realized by following the path of truth. One should always chant His
name. Even while one is performing one\'s duties, the mind should be
left with God. Suppose I have a carbuncle on my back. I perform my
duties, but the mind is drawn to the carbuncle. It is good to repeat the
