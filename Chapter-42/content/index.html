<p>AT RAM\'S HOUSE</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Saturday, May 23, 1885</p>
</blockquote>
<p>SRI RAMAKRISHNA was sitting in the drawing-room on the ground floor of
Ram\'s house. He was surrounded by</p>
<p>devotees and was conversing with them. Mahima sat in front of him, M. to
his left. Paltu, Bhavanāth,</p>
<p>Nityagopal, Haramohan, and a few others sat around him. It was about
five o\'clock in the afternoon. The</p>
<p>Master inquired after several devotees.</p>
<p>MASTER (to M.): \"Hasn\'t the younger Naren arrived yet?\"</p>
<p>Presently the younger Naren entered the room.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"What about him?\"</p>
<p>M: \"Who, sir?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Kishori. Isn\'t Girish Ghosh coming? What about Narendra?\" A
few minutes later Narendra arrived and saluted Sri Ramakrishna.</p>
<p>MASTER (to the devotees): \"It would be fine if Kedār were here. He
agrees with Girish. (To Mahima, smiling) He says the same thing.\"</p>
<p>Ram had arranged the kirtan. With folded hands the musician said to Sri
Ramakrishna, \"Sir, I can begin if you give the order.\"</p>
<p>The Master drank some water and chewed spices from a small bag. He asked
M. to close the bag.</p>
<p>The musician started the kirtan. As Sri Ramakrishna heard the sound of
the drum he went into an ecstatic mood. While listening to the prelude
of the kirtan he plunged into deep samādhi. He placed his legs on the
lap of Nityagopal, who was sitting near him. The devotee, too, was in an
ecstatic mood. He was weeping. The other devotees looked on intently.</p>
<p><strong>Nitya and Lila</strong></p>
<p>Regaining partial consciousness, Sri Ramakrishna said: \"From the Nitya
to the Lila and from the Lila to the Nitya. (To Nityagopal) What is your
ideal?\"</p>
<p>NITYAGOPAL: \"Both are good.\"</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna closed his eyes and said: \"Is it only this? Does God
exist only when the eyes are closed, and cease to exist when the eyes
are opened? The Lila belongs to Him to whom the Nitya belongs, and the
Nitya belongs to Him to whom the Lila belongs. (To Mahima) My dear sir,
let me tell you-\"</p>
<p>MAHIMA: \"Revered sir, both are according to the will of God.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Some people climb the seven floors of a building and cannot
get down; but some climb up and then, at will, visit the lower floors.</p>
<p>\"Uddhava said to the gopis: \'He whom you address as your Krishna
dwells in all beings. It is He alone who has become the universe and its
living beings.\'</p>
<p>\"Therefore I say, does a man meditate on God only when his eyes are
closed? Doesn\'t he see anything of God when his eyes are open?\"</p>
<p>MAHIMA: \"I have a question to ask, sir. A lover of God needs Nirvāna
some time or other, doesn\'t he?\"</p>
<p><strong>The seed of bhakti cannot be destroyed</strong></p>
<p>MASTER: \"It can\'t be said that bhaktas need Nirvāna. According to some
schools there is an eternal Krishna and there are also His eternal
devotees. Krishna is Spirit embodied, and His Abode also is Spirit
embodied. Krishna is eternal and the devotees also are eternal. Krishna
and the devotees are like the moon and the stars-always near each other.
You yourself repeat: \'what need is there of penance if God is seen
within and without?\' Further, I have told you that the devotee who is
born with an element of Vishnu cannot altogether get rid of bhakti.</p>
<p>Once I fell into the clutches of a Jnāni, who made me listen to Vedānta
for eleven months. But he couldn\'t altogether destroy the seed of
bhakti in me. No matter where my mind wandered, it would come back to
the Divine Mother. Whenever I sang of Her, Nangta would weep and say,
\'Ah! What is this?\' You see, he was such a great Jnāni and still he
wept. (To the younger Naren and the others) Remember the popular saying
that if a man drinks the juice of the <em>Ālekh</em> creeper, a plant grows
inside his stomach. Once the seed of bhakti is sown, the effect is
inevitable: it will gradually grow into a tree with flowers and fruits.</p>
<p>\"You may reason and argue a thousand times, but if you have the seed of
bhakti within you, you will surely come back to Hari.\"</p>
<p>The devotees listened silently to the Master. Sri Ramakrishna asked
Mahima, laughing, \"What is the thing you enjoy most?\"</p>
<p>MAHIMA (smiling): \"Nothing, sir. I like mangoes.\"</p>
<p>MASTER (smiling): \"All by yourself? Or do you want to share them with
others?\"</p>
<p>MAHIMA (smiling) : \"I am not so anxious to give others a share. I may
as well eat them all by myself.\"</p>
<p><strong>Reality includes both Absolute and universe</strong></p>
<p>MASTER: \"But do you know my attitude? I accept both, the Nitya and the
Lila. Doesn\'t God exist if one looks around with eyes open? After
realizing Him, one knows that He is both the Absolute and the universe.
It is He who is the Indivisible Satchidananda. Again, it is He who has
become the universe and its living beings.</p>
<p><strong>Futility of mere scholarship</strong></p>
<p>\"One needs <em>sādhanā</em>. Mere study of the scriptures will not do. I
noticed that though Vidyāsāgar had no doubt read a great deal, he had
not realized what was inside him; he was satisfied with helping boys get
their education, but had not tasted the Bliss of God. What will mere
study accomplish? How little one assimilates! The almanac may forecast
twenty measures of rain; but you don\'t get a drop by squeezing its
pages.\"</p>
<p>MAHIMA: \"We have so many duties in the world. Where is the time for
<em>sādhanā</em>?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Why should you say such a thing? It is you who describe the
world as illusory, like a dream.</p>
<p>\"Rāma and Lakshmana wanted to go to Ceylon. But the ocean was before
them. Lakshmana was angry. Taking his bow and arrow, he said: \'I shall
kill Varuna. This ocean prevents our going to Ceylon.\' Rāma explained
the matter to him, saying: \'Lakshmana, all that you are seeing is
unreal, like a dream. The ocean is unreal. Your anger is also unreal. It
is equally unreal to think of destroying one unreal thing by means of
another.\'\" Mahimacharan kept quiet. He had many duties in the world.
He had lately started a school to help others.</p>
<p>MASTER (to Mahima): \"Sambhu once said to me: \'I have some money. It is
my desire to spend it for good works-for schools and dispensaries,
roads, and so forth.\' I said to him: \' It will be good if you can do
these works in a selfless spirit. But it is extremely difficult to
perform unselfish action. Desire for fruit comes from nobody knows
where. Let me ask you something. Suppose God appears before you; will
you pray to Him;</p>
<p><em>Vidyā Māyā</em></p>
<p><em>Gunās</em>.\'</p>
<p>then, for such things as schools and dispensaries and hospitals?\' \"</p>
<p>A DEVOTEE: \"Sir, what is the way for worldly people?\"</p>
<p><strong>Advice to the worldly</strong></p>
<p>MASTER: \"The Company of holy men. Worldly people should listen to
spiritual talk. They are in a state of madness, intoxicated with \'woman
and gold\'. A drunkard should be given rice-water as an antidote.
Drinking it slowly, he gradually recovers his normal consciousness.</p>
<p><strong>The real teacher</strong></p>
<p>\"A worldly person should also receive instructions from a sadguru, a
real teacher. Such a teacher has certain signs. You should hear about
Banāras only from a man who has been to Banāras and seen it. Mere
book-learning will not do. One should not receive instruction from a
pundit who has not realized the world to be unreal. Only if a pundit has
discrimination and renunciation is he entitled to instruct.</p>
<p>\"Samadhyayi remarked that God was dry. Think of his speaking like that
of Him who is the embodiment of sweetness! It sounds like the remark,
\'My uncle\'s cow-shed is full of horses.\' (All laugh.)</p>
<p>\"Yes, a worldly person is in a state of intoxication. He always says to
himself: \'It is I who am doing everything. All these-the house and
family are mine.\' Baring his teeth, he says: \'What will happen to my
wife and children without me? How will they get along? Who will look
after my wife and children?\' Rākhāl said one day, \'What will happen to
my wife?\'\"</p>
<p>HARAMOHAN: \"Did Rākhāl say that?\"</p>
<p><strong>Go beyond knowledge and ignorance</strong></p>
<p>MASTER: \"What else could he do? He who has knowledge has ignorance
also. \'How amazing!\' Lakshmana said to Rāma. \'Even a sage like
Vasishtha is stricken with grief because of the death of his sons!\'
\'Brother,\' replied Rāma, \'he who has knowledge has ignorance also.
Therefore go beyond both knowledge and ignorance.\'</p>
<p>\"Suppose a thorn has pierced a man\'s foot. He picks another thorn to
pull out the first one. After extracting the first thorn with the help
of the second, he throws both away. One should use the thorn of
knowledge to pull out the thorn of ignorance. Then one throws away both
the thorns, knowledge and ignorance, and attains vijnāna. What is
vijnāna? It is to know God distinctly by realizing His existence through
an intuitive experience</p>
<p>and to speak to Him intimately. That is why Sri Krishna said to Arjuna,
\'Go beyond the three</p>
<p>\"In order to attain vijnāna one has to accept the help of <em>Vidyā Māyā</em>.
<em>Vidyā Māyā</em> includes discriminationthat is to say, God is real and the
world illusory-and dispassion, and also chanting God\'s name and
glories,</p>
<p>meditation, the company of holy persons, prayer, and so forth. may be
likened to the last few</p>
<p>steps before the roof. Next is the roof, the realization of God.</p>
<p><strong>Nature of the worldly</strong></p>
<p>\"Worldly people are in a state of chronic intoxication-mad with \'woman
and gold\'; they are insensible to spiritual ideas. That is why I love
the youngsters not yet stained by \'woman and gold\'. They are \'good
receptacles\' and may become useful in God\'s work. But as for worldly
people, you lose almost everything while trying to eliminate the
worthless stuff in them. They are like bony fish-almost all bones and
very little meat.</p>
<p>\"Worldly people are like mangoes struck by hail. If you want to offer
them to God, you have to purify them by sprinkling them with Ganges
water. Even then they are seldom used in the temple worship. If you are
to use them at all, you have to apply Brahmajnana, that is to say, you
have to persuade yourself that it is God alone who has become
everything.\"</p>
<p>A Theosophist gentleman arrived with Aswini Kumar Dutta and the son of
Behari Bhaduri. The Mukherji brothers entered the room and saluted Sri
Ramakrishna. Arrangements were being made for devotional music</p>
<p>in the courtyard. At the first beat of the drum the Master left the room
and went there. The devotees followed him.</p>
<p>Bhavanāth introduced Aswini to the Master. The Master introduced him to
M. Aswini and M. were talking together when Narendra arrived. Sri
Ramakrishna said to Aswini, \"this is Narendra.\"</p>
<p><strong>Saturday, June 13, 1885</strong></p>
<p>About three o\'clock in the afternoon Sri Ramakrishna was resting in his
room after the midday meal. A pundit was sitting on a mat on the floor.
Near the north door of the room stood a brahmin woman who had recently
lost her only daughter and was stricken with grief. Kishori, too, was in
the room. M. arrived and saluted the Master. He was accompanied by Dwija
and a few other devotees.</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna was not well. He had been suffering from an inflamed
throat. These were the hot days of summer. M. was not keeping well
either, and of late he had not been able to visit Sri Ramakrishna
frequently.</p>
<p>MASTER (to M.): \"How are you? It is nice to see you. The bel-fruit you
sent me was very good.\"</p>
<p>M: \"I am slightly better now, sir.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"It is very hot. Take a little ice now and then. I have been
feeling the heat very much myself; so I ate a great deal of ice-cream.
That is why I have this sore throat. The saliva smells very bad.</p>
<p><strong>Master\'s adherence to truth</strong></p>
<p>\"I have said to the Divine Mother: \'Mother, make me well. I shall not
eat ice-cream any more.\' Next I said to Her that I wouldn\'t eat ice
either. Since I have given my word to the Mother, I shall certainly not
eat these things. But sometimes I become forgetful. Once I said that I
wouldn\'t eat fish on Sundays; but one Sunday I forgot and ate fish. But
I cannot consciously go back on my word. The other day I asked a devotee
to bring my water-jug to the pine-grove. As he had to go elsewhere,
another man brought the jug. But I couldn\'t use that water. I was
helpless. I waited there until the first man brought water for me.</p>
<p>\"When I renounced everything with an offering of flowers at the Lotus
Feet of the Mother, I said: \'Here, Mother, take Thy holiness, take Thy
unholiness. Here, Mother, take Thy dharma, take Thy adharma. Here,
Mother, take Thy sin, take Thy virtue. Here, Mother, take Thy good, take
Thy evil. And give me only pure bhakti.\' But I could not say, \'Here,
Mother, take Thy truth, take Thy falsehood.\' \"</p>
<p>A devotee had brought some ice. Again and again the Master asked M.,
\"Shall I eat it?\"</p>
<p>M: said humbly, \"Please don\'t eat it without consulting the Mother:\"
Sri Ramakrishna could not take the ice.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"It is the bhakta, and not the Jnāni, who discriminates between
holiness and unholiness. Vijay\'s</p>
<p>mother-in-law said to me: \'How little I have achieved of my spiritual
ideal! I cannot take food from everybody.\' I said to her: \'Is eating
everybody\'s food a sign of jnāna? A dog eats anything and everything.
Does that make it a Jnāni?\'</p>
<p>(To M.) \"Why do I eat a variety of dishes? In order not to become
monotonous. Otherwise I should have to renounce the devotees.</p>
<p>\"I said to Keshab: \'If I instruct you from a still higher standpoint,
then you won\'t be able to preserve your organization. In the state of
jnāna organizations and things like that become unreal, like a dream.\'</p>
<p>\"One time I gave up fish. At first I suffered from it; afterwards it
didn\'t bother me much. If someone burns up a bird\'s nest, the bird
flies about; it takes shelter in the sky. If a man truly realizes that
the body and the world are unreal, then his soul attains samādhi.</p>
<p>\"Formerly I had the state of mind of a Jnāni: I couldn\'t enjoy the
company of men. I would hear that a Jnāni or a bhakta lived at a certain
place; then, a few days later, I would learn that he was dead.
Everything seemed</p>
<p>to me impermanent; so I couldn\'t enjoy people\'s company. Later the
Mother brought my mind down to a lower plane; She so changed my mind
that I could enjoy love of God and His devotees.\"</p>
<p><strong>Divine Incarnation</strong></p>
<p>Next the Master began to talk about Divine Incarnation.</p>
<p>MASTER (to M.): \"Do you know why God incarnates Himself as a man? It is
because through a human body one can hear His words. He sports through
it. He tastes divine bliss through a human body. But through His other
devotees God manifests only a small part of Himself. A devotee is like
something you get a little juice from after much sucking - like a flower
you get a drop of honey from after much sucking. (To M.) Do you
understand this?\"</p>
<p>M: \"Yes, sir. Very well\"</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna began to talk to Dwija, who was about sixteen years old.
His father had married a second time. Dwija often accompanied M. to
Dakshineswar, and Sri Ramakrishna was fond of him. The boy said that his
father opposed his coming to Dakshineswar.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"And your brothers too? Do they speak slightingly of me?\"</p>
<p>Dwija did not answer.</p>
<p>M. (to the Master): \"Those who speak slightingly of you will be cured
of it after getting a few more blows from the world.\"</p>
<p>MASTER (referring to Dwija\'s brothers): \"They live with their
step-mother. So they are getting blows.\"</p>
<p>All were silent a moment.</p>
<p>MASTER (to M.): \"Introduce Dwija to Purna some time.\"</p>
<p>M: \"Yes, I shall. (To Dwija) Go to Panihati.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"I am asking everyone to send people to Panihati. (To M.)
Won\'t you go?\"</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna intended to visit the religious festival at Panihati; so
he was asking the devotees to go too.</p>
<p>M: \"Yes, sir, I want to go.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"We shall engage a big boat; then it won\'t toss about. Will
Girish Ghosh be there?\"</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna looked steadily at Dwija.</p>
<p>Master: \"Well, there are so many youngsters in the city; why does this
boy come here? (To M,) Tell me what you think. Certainly he has
inherited some good tendencies from his previous birth.\"</p>
<p>M: \"Undoubtedly, sir.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"There is such a thing as inborn tendencies. When a man has
performed many good actions in his previous births, in the final birth
he becomes guileless. In the final birth he acts somewhat like a madcap.</p>
<p>\"To tell you the truth, everything happens by God\'s will. When He says
\'Yea\', everything comes to pass, and when He says \'Nay\', everything
comes to a standstill.</p>
<p>\"Why is it that one man should not bless another? Because nothing can
happen by man\'s will: things come to pass or disappear by God\'s will.</p>
<p>\'The other day I went to Captain\'s house. I saw some young boys going
along the road. They belong to a different class. I saw one of them,
about nineteen or twenty years old, with his hair parted on the side. He
was whistling as he walked along.</p>
<p>\"I see some immersed in the thickest tamas. They play the flute and are
proud of it.</p>
<p>(To Dwija) \"Why should a man of Knowledge be afraid of criticism? His
understanding is as immovable as the anvil in a blacksmith\'s shop.
Blows from the hammer fall continually on the anvil but cannot affect it
in the least.</p>
<p>\"I saw X-\'s father going along the street.\"</p>
<ol>
<li>\"He is a very artless man.\" MASTER: \"But he has red eyes.\"</li>
</ol>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna told the devotees about his visit to Captain\'s house.
Captain had criticized the young men who visited the Master. Perhaps
Hazra had poisoned his mind.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"I was talking to Captain. I said: \'Nothing exists except
Purusha and Prakriti. Nārada said to Rāma, \"O Rāma, all the men You see
are parts of Yourself, and all the women are parts of Sita.\" \'</p>
<p>\"Captain was highly pleased. He said: \'You alone have the right
perception. All men are really Rāma, being parts of Rāma; all women are
really Sita, being parts of Sita.\'</p>
<p><strong>Master reprimands Captain</strong></p>
<p>\"Immediately after saying this he began to criticize the young
devotees. He said: \'They study English books and don\'t discriminate
about their food. It is not good that they should visit you frequently.
It may do you harm. Hazra is a real man, a grand fellow. Don\'t allow
those young people to visit you so much.\' At first I said, \'What can I
do if they come?\' Then I gave him some mortal blows. His daughter
laughed. I said to him: \'God is far, far away from the worldly-minded.
But God is very near the man-nay, within a distance of three
cubits-whose mind is free from worldliness.\' Speaking of Rākhāl ,
Captain said, \'He eats with all sorts of people.\' Perhaps he had heard
it from Hazra. Thereupon I said to him: \'A man may practise intense
austerity and japa, but he won\'t achieve anything if his mind dwells on
the world. But blessed is the man who keeps his mind on God even though
he eats pork. He will certainly realize God in due time. Hazra, with all
his austerity and japa, doesn\'t allow an opportunity to slip by for
earning money as a broker.\'</p>
<p>\"\'Yes, yes!\' said Captain. \'You are right.\' I said to him further,
\'A few minutes ago you said that all men were parts of Rāma and all
women parts of Sita, and now you are talking like this!\'</p>
<p>\"Captain said: \'Yes, that\'s true. But you don\'t love everybody.\'</p>
<p>\"I said: \'According to the scriptures, water is God. We see water
everywhere. But some water we drink, some we bathe in, and some we use
for washing dirty things. Here sit your wife and daughter. I see them as
embodiments of the Blessed Mother.\'</p>
<p>\"Thereupon Captain said, \'Yes, yes! That\'s true.\' He wanted to
apologize by touching my feet.\"</p>
<p>After speaking thus, Sri Ramakrishna laughed. Then he began to tell of
Captain\'s many virtues.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Captain has many virtues. Every day he attends to his
devotions. He himself performs the worship of the Family Deity. How many
mantras he recites while bathing the image! He is a great ritualist. He
performs his daily devotions, such as worship, japa, <em>Ārati</em>, recital of
the scriptures, and chanting of hymns.</p>
<p>\"I scolded Captain and said: \'Too much reading has spoiled you. Don\'t
read any more.\'</p>
<p>\"About my own spiritual state Captain said, \'Your soul, like a bird,
is ready to fly.\' There are two entities: jivatma, the embodied soul,
and Paramatma, the Supreme Soul. The embodied soul is the bird. The
Supreme Soul is like the Ākāśa; it is the Chidakasa, the Ākāśa of
Consciousness. Captain said: \'Your embodied soul flies into the Ākāśa
of Consciousness. Thus you go into samādhi.\'</p>
<p>(Smiling) \"He critisized the Bengalis. He said: \'The Bengalis are
fools. They have a gem near them, but they cannot recognize it.\'</p>
<p>\"Captain\'s father was a great devotee. He was a <em>Subedar</em> in the
English army. Even on the battle-field he would perform his worship at
the proper time. With one hand he would worship Śiva and with the other
he would wield his gun and sword.</p>
<p>(To M.) \"But Captain is engaged in worldly duties day and night.
Whenever I go to his house I see him surrounded by his wife and
children. Besides, his men bring him their account books now and then.
But at times his mind dwells on God also. It is like the case of a
typhoid patient who is always in a delirium. Now and then he gets a
flash of consciousness and cries out: \'I want a drink of water! I want
a drink of water!\' But while you are giving him the water, he becomes
unconscious again and is not aware of anything. I said to Captain, \'You
are a ritualist.\' He said: \'Yes, I feel very happy while performing
worship and things like that. Worldly people have no other way.\'</p>
<p>\"I said to him: \' but must one perform formal worship for ever? How
long does a bee buzz about? As long as it hasn\'t lighted on a flower.
While sipping honey it doesn\'t buzz.\' \'But\', he said, \'can we, like
you, give up worship and other rituals?\' Yet he doesn\'t always say the
same thing. Sometimes he says that all this is inert, sometimes that all
this is conscious. I say: \'What do you mean by inert? Everything is
Chaitanya, Consciousness.\'\"</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna asked M. about Purna.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"If I see Purna once more, then my longing for him will
diminish. How intelligent he is! His mind is much drawn to me. He says,
\'I too feel a strange sensation in my heart for you.\' (To M.) They
have taken him away from your school. Will that harm you?\"</p>
<ol>
<li>\"If Vidyāsāgar tells me that Purna\'s relatives have taken him away
    from the school on my account, I have an explanation to give him.\"</li>
</ol>
<p>MASTER: \"What will you say?\"</p>
<ol>
<li>\"I shall say that one thinks of God in holy company. That is by no
    means bad. Further, I shall tell him that the text-books prescribed
    by the school authorities say that one should love God with all
    one\'s soul\" (The Master laughs.)</li>
</ol>
<p>MASTER : \"At Captain\'s house I sent for the younger Naren. I said to
him:\' where is your house? I want to see it.\' \'Please do come\', he
said. But he became nervous as we were going there, lest his father
should know about it. (All laugh.)</p>
<p>(To a visitor) \"You haven\'t been here for a long time-about seven or
eight months.\"</p>
<p>VISITOR: \"About a year, sir.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Another gentleman used to come with you.\"</p>
<p>VISITOR: \"Yes, sir. Nilmani Babu.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Why doesn\'t he come any more? Ask him to come some time. I
want to see him. Who is this boy with you?\"</p>
<p>VISITOR: \"He comes from Assam.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Where is Assam? In which direction?\"</p>
<p>Dwija spoke to the Master about Ashu. Ashu\'s father was arranging for
his marriage, but Ashu had no wish to marry.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"See, he doesn\'t want to marry. They are forcing him.\"</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna said to a devotee that he should show respect to his
elder brother. He said: \"The elder brother is like one\'s father.
Respect him.\"</p>
<p>A pundit was sitting with the devotees. He came from upper India.</p>
<p>MASTER (smiling, to M.): \"The pundit is a great student of the
Bhagavata.\"</p>
<p>M. and the devotees looked at the pundit.</p>
<p>MASTER (to the pundit): \"Well, sir, what is Yogamaya?\"</p>
<p>The pundit gave some sort of explanation.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Why isn\'t Radhika called Yogamaya?\"</p>
<p>The pundit also answered this question after a fashion.</p>
<p><strong>Significance of Radhika</strong></p>
<p>MASTER: \"Radhika is full of unmixed sattva, the embodiment of prema.
Yogamaya contains all the three <em>Gunās</em>-sattva, rajas, and tamas; but
Radhika has nothing but pure sattva.(To M.) \"Narendra now respects
Radhika very much. He says that if anyone wants to know how to love
Satchidananda, he can learn it from her.</p>
<p>\"Satchidananda wanted to taste divine bliss for Itself. That is why It
created Radhika. She was created from the person of Satchidananda
Krishna. Satchidananda Krishna is the \'container\', and He Himself, in
the form of Radhika, is the \'contained\'. He manifested Himself in that
way in order to taste His own bliss, that is to say, in order to
experience divine bliss by loving Satchidananda.</p>
<p>\"Therefore it is written in the Vaishnava books that after her birth
Radhika did not open her eyes. The idea is that she did not wish to see
any human being. Yaśoda came with Krishna in her arms to see Radhika.
Only then did she open her eyes, to behold Krishna. In a playful mood
Krishna touched her eyes. (To the Assamese boy) Haven\'t you seen this?
Small children touch others\' eyes with their hands.\"</p>
<p>The pundit was about to take leave of Sri Ramakrishna.</p>
<p>PUNDIT: \"I must go home.\"</p>
<p>MASTER (tenderly): \"Have you earned anything?\"</p>
<p>PUNDIT: \"The market is very dull. I\'ve earned nothing.\"</p>
<p>A few minutes later he saluted the Master and departed.</p>
<p>MASTER (to M.): \"You see how great the difference is between worldly
people and the youngsters? This pundit has been worrying about money day
and night. He has come to Calcutta to earn money; otherwise his people
at home will have nothing to eat. So he has to knock at different doors.
When will he concentrate his mind on God? But the youngsters are
untouched by \'woman and gold\'; hence they can direct their mind to God</p>
<p>whenever they desire.</p>
<p>\"The youngsters do not enjoy worldly people\'s company. Rākhāl used to
say, \'I feel nervous at the sight of the worldly-minded.\' When I was
first beginning to have spiritual experiences, I used to shut the doors
of my room when I saw worldly people coming.</p>
<p><strong>Master\'s boyhood reminiscences</strong></p>
<p>\"As a boy, at Kamarpukur, I loved Ram Mallick dearly. But afterwards,
when he came here, I couldn\'t even touch him. Ram Mallick and I were
great friends during our boyhood. We were together day and night; we
slept together. At that time I was sixteen or seventeen years old.
People used to say, \'If one of them were a woman they would marry each
other.\' Both of us used to play at his house. I remember those days
very well. His relatives used to come riding in palanquins. Now he has a
shop at Chanak. I sent for him many a time; he came here the other day
and spent two days. Ram said he had no children; he brought up his
nephew, but the boy died. He told me this with a sigh; his eyes were
filled with tears; he was grief-stricken for his nephew. He said further
that since they had no children of their own, all his wife\'s affection
had been turned to the nephew. She was completely overwhelmed with
grief. Ram said to her: \'You are crazy. What will you gain by grieving?
Do you want to go to Banāras?\' You see, he called his wife crazy. Grief
for the boy totally \'diluted\' him. I found he had no stuff in him. I
couldn\'t touch him.\"</p>
<p>The brahmin lady still stood near the north door. She was a widow. Her
only daughter had been married to a very aristocratic man, a landlord in
Calcutta with the title of Raja. Whenever the daughter visited her she
was escorted by liveried footmen. Then the mother\'s heart swelled with
pride. Just a few days ago the daughter had died, and now she was beside
herself with sorrow.</p>
<p>The brahmin lady listened to the account of Ram Mallick s grief for his
nephew. For the last few days she had been running to the Master from
her home at Baghbazar like an insane person. She was eager to know
whether Sri Ramakrishna could suggest any remedy for her unquenchable
grief. Sri Ramakrishna resumed the conversation.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"A man came here the other day. He sat a few minutes and then
said, \'Let me go and see the \"moon-face\" of my child.\' I couldn\'t
control myself and said: \'So you prefer your son\'s \"moon-face\" to
God\'s \"moon-face\"! Get out, you fool!\'</p>
<p><strong>Magician and his magic</strong></p>
<p>(To M.) \"The truth is that God alone is real and all else unreal. Men,
universe, house, and children-all these are like the magic of the
magician. The magician strikes his wand and says: \'come delusion! Come
confusion!\' Then he says to the audience, \'Open the lid of the pot;
see the birds fly into the sky.\' But the magician alone is real and his
magic unreal. The unreal exists for a second and then vanishes.</p>
<p>\"Śiva was seated in Kailas. His companion Nandi was near Him. Suddenly
a terrific noise arose. \'Revered Sir,\' asked Nandi, \'what does that
mean?\' Śiva said: \'Ravana is born. That is its meaning.\' A few
moments later another terrific noise was heard. \'Now what is this
noise?\' Nandi asked. Śiva said with a smile, \'Now Ravana is dead.
Birth and death are like magic: you see the magic for a second and then
it disappears. God alone is real and all else unreal. Water alone is
real; its bubbles appear and disappear. They disappear into the very
water from which they rise.</p>
<p>\"God is like an ocean, and living beings are its bubbles. They are born
there and they die there. Children are like the few small bubbles around
a big one.</p>
<p>\"God alone is real. Make an effort to cultivate love for Him and find
out the means to realize Him. What will you gain by grieving?\"</p>
<p>All sat in silence. The brahmin lady said, \"May I go home now? The
Master said to her tenderly: \"Do you want to go now? It is very hot.
Why now? You can go later in a carriage with the devotees.\"</p>
<p>Because the day was so hot, a devotee gave the Master a new fan made of
sandalwood. He was very much pleased and said: \"Good! Good! Om Tat Sat!
Kāli!\" First he fanned the pictures of the gods and goddesses, and then
he fanned himself. He said to M.: \"See! Feel the breeze!\" M. Was
highly pleased.</p>
<p>Captain arrived with his children.</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna said to Kishori, \"Please show the temples to the
children.\" He began to talk to Captain. M., Dwija, and the other
devotees were sitting on the floor. Sri Ramakrishna was sitting on the
small couch, facing the north. He asked Captain to sit in front of him
on the same couch.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"I was telling the devotees about you-your devotion, worship,
and <em>Ārati</em>.\"</p>
<p>CAPTAIN (bashfully): \"What do I know of worship and <em>Ārati</em>? How
insignificant I am!\"</p>
<p><strong>Harmless ego</strong></p>
<p>MASTER: \"Only the ego that is attached to \'woman and. gold\' is
harmful. But the ego that feels it is the servant of God does no harm to
anybody. Neither does the ego of a child, which is not under the control
of any <em>guna</em>. One moment children quarrel, and the next moment they are
on friendly terms. One moment they build their toy houses with great
care, and immediately afterwards they knock them down. There is no harm
in the \'I-consciousness\' that makes one feel oneself to be a child of
God or His servant. This ego is really no ego at all. It is like sugar
candy, which is not like other sweets. Other sweets make one ill; but
sugar candy relieves acidity. Or take the case of Om. It is unlike other
sounds.</p>
<p>\"With this kind of ego one is able to love Satchidananda. It is
impossible to get rid of the ego. Therefore it should be made to feel
that it is the devotee of God, His servant. Otherwise, how can one live?
How intense was the love of the gopis for Sri Krishna! (To Captain)
Please tell us something about the gopis. You read the Bhagavata so
much.\"</p>
<p>CAPTAIN: \"When Sri Krishna lived at Vrindāvan, without any of His royal
splendour, even then the gopis loved Him more than their own souls.
Therefore Sri Krishna said, \'How shall I be able to pay off my debt to
the gopis, who surrendered to me their all-their bodies, minds, and
souls?\' \"</p>
<p>Captain\'s words awakened intense love for Krishna in the Master\'s
mind.</p>
<p>He exclaimed, \"Govinda! Govinda! Govinda!\" and was about to go into an
ecstatic mood. Captain was amazed and said: \"How blessed he is! How
blessed he is!\"</p>
<p>Captain and the devotees watched this love-ecstasy of Sri Ramakrishna.
They sat quietly gazing at him, awaiting his return to the consciousness
of the world.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Tell us more.\"</p>
<p>CAPTAIN: \"Sri Krishna is unattainable by the yogis, by yogis like you;
but He can be attained by lovers like the gopis. How many years did the
yogis practise yoga for His vision! Yet they did not succeed. But the
gopis realized Him with such ease!\"</p>
<p>MASTER (smiling): \"Yes, He ate from the hands of the gopis, wept for
them, played with them, and made many demands on them.\"</p>
<p>A DEVOTEE: \"Bankim has written a life of Krishna.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"He accepts Krishna but not Radhika.\"</p>
<p>CAPTAIN: \"I see he doesn\'t accept Krishna\'s lila with the gopis.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"I also hear that Bankim says that one needs passions such as
lust.\"</p>
<p>A DEVOTEE: \"He has written in his magazine that the purpose of religion
is to give expression to our various</p>
<p>faculties: physical, mental, and spiritual.\"</p>
<p>CAPTAIN: \"I see. He believes that lust and so forth are necessary. But
he doesn\'t believe that Sri Krishna could enjoy His sportive pleasure
in the world, that God could incarnate Himself in a human form and sport
in Vrindāvan with Radha and the gopis.\"</p>
<p>MASTER (smiling): \"But these things are, not written in the newspaper.
How could he believe them?</p>
<p>\"A man said to his friend, \'Yesterday, as I was passing through a
certain part of the city, I saw a house fall with a crash.\' \'Wait\',
said the friend. \'Let me look it up in the newspaper.\' But this
incident wasn\'t mentioned in the paper. Thereupon the man said, \'But
the paper doesn\'t mention it.\' His friend replied, \'I saw it with my
own eyes.\' \'Be that as it may, said the man, \'I can\'t believe it as
long as it isn\'t in the paper.\'</p>
<p>\"How can Bankim believe that God sports about as a man? He doesn\'t get
it from his English education. It is very hard to explain how God fully
incarnates Himself as man. Isn\'t that so? The manifestation of Infinity
in this human body only three and a half cubits tall!\"</p>
<p>CAPTAIN: \"Krishna is God Himself. In describing Him we have to use such
terms as \'whole\' and \'part\'.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Whole and part are like fire and its sparks. An Incarnation of
God is for the sake of the bhaktas and not of the jnanis. It is said in
the Adhyātma Rāmāyana that Rāma alone is both the Pervading Spirit and
everything pervaded. \'You are the Supreme Lord distinguished as the
<em>Vachaka,</em> the signifying symbol, and the <em>Vachya</em>, the object
signified.\'\"</p>
<p>CAPTAIN: \"The \'signifying symbol\' means the pervader, and the
\'object signified\' means the thing pervaded.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"The pervader in this case is a finite form, It is God
incarnating Himself as a human being.\"</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna was talking thus to Captain and the devotees when
Jaygopal Sen and Trailokya of the Brahmo Samaj arrived. They saluted the
Master and sat down. Sri Ramakrishna looked at Trailokya with a smile
and continued the conversation.</p>
<p><strong>\"Wicked ego\" must be killed</strong></p>
<p>MASTER: \"It is on account of the ego that one is not able to see God.
In front of the door of God\'s mansion lies the stump of ego. One cannot
enter the mansion without jumping over the stump.</p>
<p>\"There was once a man who had acquired the power to tame ghosts. One
day, at his summons, a ghost appeared. The ghost said: \'now tell me
what you want me to do. The moment you cannot give me any work I shall
break your neck.\' The man had many things to accomplish, and he had the
ghost do them all, one by one. At last he could find nothing more for
the ghost to do. \'Now\', said the ghost, \'I am going to break your
neck.\' \'Wait a minute\', said the man. \'I shall return presently.\'
He ran to his teacher and said: \'Revered sir, I am in great danger.
This is my trouble.\' And he told his teacher his trouble and asked,
\'What shall I do now?\' The teacher said: \' do this. Tell the ghost to
straighten this kinky hair.\' The ghost devoted itself day and night to
straightening the hair. But how could it make a kinky hair straight? The
hair remained kinky.</p>
<p>\"Likewise, the ego seems to vanish this moment, but it reappears the
next. Unless one renounces the ego, one does not receive the grace of
God.</p>
<p>\"Suppose there is a feast in a house and the master of the house puts a
man in charge of the stores. As long as the man remains in the
store-room, the master doesn\'t go there; but when of his own wills he
renounces the store-room and goes away, then the master locks it and
takes charge of it himself.</p>
<p>\"A guardian is appointed only for a minor. A boy cannot safeguard his
property; therefore the king assumes responsibility for him. God does
not take over our responsibilities unless we renounce our ego.</p>
<p>\"Once Lakshmi and Narayana were seated in Vaikuntha, when Narayana
suddenly stood up. Lakshmi had been stroking His feet. She said, \'Lord,
where are You going?\' Narayana answered: \'One of My devotees is in
great danger. I must save him.\' With these words He went out. But He
came back immediately. Lakshmi said, \'Lord, why have You returned so
soon?\' Narayana smiled and said: The devotee was going along the road
overwhelmed with love for Me. Some washermen were drying clothes on the
grass, and the devotee walked over the clothes. At this the washermen
chased him and were going to beat him with their sticks. So I ran out to
protect him.\' \'But why have You come back?\' asked Lakshmi. Narayana
laughed and said: \'I saw the devotee himself picking up a brick to
throw at them. (All laugh.) So I came back.\'</p>
<p>\"I said to Keshab, \'You must renounce your ego.\' Keshab replied, \'If
I do, how can I keep my organization together?\'</p>
<p>\"I said to him: \'how slow you are to understand! I am not asking you
to renounce the \"ripe ego\", the ego that makes a man feel he is a
servant of God or His devotee. Give up the \"unripe ego\", the ego that
creates attachment to \"woman and gold\". The ego that makes a man feels
he is God\'s servant. His child is the \"ripe ego\". It doesn\'t harm
one.\'\"</p>
<p>TRAILOKYA: \"It is very difficult to get rid of the ego. People only
think they are free from it.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Gauri would not refer to himself as \'I\' lest he should feel
egotistic. He would say \'this\' instead. I followed his example and
would refer to myself as \'this\' instead of \'I\'. Instead of saying,
\'I have eaten,\' I would say, \'This has eaten.\' Mathur noticed it and
said one day: \'What is this, revered father? Why should you talk that
way? Let them talk that way. They have their egotism. You are free from
it; you don\'t have to talk like them.\'</p>
<p>\"I said to Keshab, \'Since the ego cannot be given up, let it remain as
the servant, the servant of God.\' Prahlada had two moods. Sometimes he
would feel that he was God. In that mood he would say, \'Thou art verily
I, and I am verily Thou.\' But when he was conscious of his ego, he felt
that God was the Master and he was His servant. After a man is firmly
established in the ideal of \'I am He\', he can live as God\'s servant.
He may then think of himself as the servant of God.</p>
<p><strong>Signs of God-realization</strong></p>
<p>(To Captain) \"When a man attains the Knowledge of Brahman he shows
certain characteristics. The Bhagavata describes four of them: the state
of a child, of an inert thing, of a madman, and of a ghoul. Sometimes
the knower of Brahman acts like a five-year-old child. Sometimes he acts
like a madman. Sometimes he remains like an inert thing. In this state
he cannot work; he renounces all action. You may say that jnanis like
Janaka were active. The truth is that people in olden times gave
responsibility to their subordinate officers and thus freed themselves
from worry. Further, at that time men possessed intense faith.\"</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna began to speak about the renunciation of action. But he
also said that those who felt they must do their duties should do them
in a detached spirit.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"After attaining Knowledge one cannot do much work.\"</p>
<p>TRAILOKYA: \"Why so, sir? Pavahari Baba was a great yogi and yet he
reconciled people\'s quarrels, even lawsuits.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Yes, yes. That\'s true. Dr. Durgacharan was a great drunkard.
He used to drink twenty-four hours a day. But he was precise in his
actions; he did not make any mistake in treating his patients. There is
no harm in doing work after the attainment of bhakti. But it is very
hard. One needs intense <em>tapasya</em>.</p>
<p>\"It is God who does everything. We are His instruments. Some Sikhs said
to me in front of the Kāli temple, \'God is compassionate.\' I said,
\'to whom is He compassionate?\' \'Why, revered sir, to all of us\',
said the Sikhs. I said: \'We are His children. Does compassion to one\'s
own children mean much? A father must look after his children; or do you
expect the people of the neighbourhood to bring them up?\' Well, won\'t
those who say that God is compassionate ever understand that we are
God\'s children and not someone else\'s?\"</p>
<p>CAPTAIN: \"You are right. They don\'t regard God as their own.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Should we not, then, address God as compassionate? Of course
we should, as long as we practise <em>sādhanā</em>. After realizing God, one
rightly feels that God is our Father or Mother. As long as we have not
realized God, we feel that we are far away from Him, children of someone
else.</p>
<p>\"During the stage of <em>sādhanā</em> one should describe God by all His
attributes. One day Hazra said to Narendra: \'God is Infinity. Infinite
is His, splendour. Do you think He will accept your offerings of sweets
and bananas or listen to your music? This is a mistaken notion of
yours.\' Narendra at once sank ten fathoms. So I said to Hazra, \'you
villain! Where will these youngsters be if you talk to them like that?\'
How can a man live if he gives up devotion? No doubt God has infinite
splendour; yet He is under the control of His devotees. A rich man\'s
gate-keeper comes to the parlour where his master is seated with his
friends. He stands on one side of the room. In his hand he has something
covered with a cloth. He is very hesitant. The master asks him, \'Well,
gate-keeper, what have you in your hand?\' Very hesitantly the servant
takes out a custard-apple from under the cover, places it in front of
his master, and says, \'Sir, it is my desire that you should eat this.\'
The Master is impressed by his servant\'s devotion with great love he
takes the fruit in his hand and says: \'Ah! This is a very nice
custard-apple. Where did you pick it? You must have taken a great deal
of trouble to get it.\'</p>
<p>\"God is under the control of His devotees. King Duryodhana was very
attentive to Krishna and said to Him, \'Please have your meal here.\'
But the Lord went to Vidura\'s hut. He is very fond of His devotees. He
ate Vidura\'s simple rice and greens as if they were celestial food.</p>
<p>\"Sometimes a perfect Jnāni behaves like a ghoul. He does not
discriminate about food and drink, holiness and unholiness. A perfect
knower of God and a perfect idiot have the same outer signs. A perfect
Jnāni perhaps does not utter the mantras while bathing in the Ganges.
While worshipping, God, perhaps he offers all the flowers together at
His feet. He doesn\'t utter the mantras, nor does he observe the
rituals.</p>
<p>\"A man cannot renounce action as long as he desires worldly enjoyment.
As long as one cherishes a desire for enjoyment, one performs action.</p>
<p>\"A bird sat absent-mindedly on the mast of a ship anchored in the
Ganges. Slowly the ship sailed out into the ocean. When the bird came to
its senses, it could find no shore in any direction. It flew toward the
north hoping to reach land; it went very far and grew very tired but
could find no shore. What could it do? It returned to the ship and sat
on the mast. After a long while the bird flew away again, this time
toward the east. It couldn\'t find land in that direction either;
everywhere it saw nothing but limitless ocean. Very tired, it again
returned to the ship and sat on the mast. After resting a long while,
the bird went toward the south and toward the west. When it found no
sign of land in any direction, it came back and settled down on the
mast. It did not leave the mast again, but sat there without making any
further effort. It no longer felt restless or worried. Because it was
free from worry, it made no further effort.\"</p>
<p>CAPTAIN: \"Ah, what an illustration!\"</p>
<p><strong>Man\'s peace in God</strong></p>
<p>MASTER: \"Worldly people wander about to the four quarters of the earth
for the sake of happiness. They don\'t find it anywhere; they only
become tired and weary. When through their attachment to \'woman and
gold\' they only suffer misery, they feel an urge toward dispassion and
renunciation. Most people cannot renounce \'woman and gold\' without
first enjoying it.</p>
<p>There are two sorts of people: those who stay in one place and those who
go about to many places. There are some sadhakas who visit many sacred
places. They cannot settle down in one spot; they must drink the water
of many holy places. Thus roaming about, they satisfy their unfulfilled
desires. And at last they build a hut in one place and settle down
there. Then, free from worry and effort, they meditate on God.</p>
<p>\"But what is there to enjoy in the world? \'Woman and gold\'? That is
only a momentary pleasure. One moment it exists and the next moment it
disappears. \'</p>
<p><strong>Sincere yearning enables one to realize God</strong></p>
<p>\"The world is like an overcast sky that steadily pours down rain: the
face of the sun is seldom seen. There is mostly suffering in the world.
On account of the cloud of \'woman and gold\' one cannot see the sun.
Some people ask me: \'Sir, why has God created such a world? Is there no
way out for us?\' I say to them: \'why shouldn\'t there be a way out?
Take shelter with God and pray to Him with a yearning heart for a
favourable wind, that you may have things in your favour. If you call on
Him with yearning, He will surely listen to you.\'</p>
<p>\"A man had a son who was on the point of death. In frenzy he asked
remedies of different people. One of them said:\' \'Here is a remedy:
First it must rain when the star <em>Svati</em> is in the ascendant; then some
of the rain must fall into a skull; then a frog must come there to drink
the water, and a snake must chase it; and when the snake is about to
bite the frog, the frog must hop away and the poison must fall into the
skull. You should give the patient a little of the poison and rain-water
from the skull.\' The father set out eagerly to find the medicine when
the star Svati was in the sky. It started raining. Fervently he said to
God, \'O Lord, please get a skull for me.\' Searching here and there, he
at last found a skull with rain-water in it. Again he prayed to God,
saying, \'O Lord, I beseech Thee, please help me find the frog and the
snake.\' Since he had great longing, he got the frog and the snake also.
In the twinkling of an eye he saw a snake chasing a frog, and as it was
about to bite the frog, its poison fell into the skull.</p>
<p>\"If one takes shelter with God and prays to Him with great longing, God
will surely listen; He will certainly make everything favourable.\"</p>
<p>CAPTAIN: \"What an apt illustration!\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Yes, God makes everything favourable. Perhaps the aspirant
Doesn\'t marry. Thus he is able to devote his whole attention to God. Or
perhaps his brothers earn the family\'s livelihood. Or perhaps a son
takes on the responsibilities of the family. Then the aspirant will not
have to bother about the world; he can give one hundred per cent of his
mind to God.</p>
<p>\"But one cannot succeed unless one renounces \'woman and gold\'. Only
by renunciation is ignorance destroyed. The sun\'s rays, falling on a
lens, burn many objects. But if a room is dark inside, you cannot get
that result: \'you must come out of the room to use the lens.</p>
<p>\"But some people live in the world even after attaining jnāna. They see
both what is inside and what is outside the room. The light of God
illumines the world. Therefore with that light they can discriminate
between good and bad, permanent and impermanent. The ignorant, who lead
a worldly life without knowing God, are like people living in a house
with mud walls.</p>
<p>With the help of a dim light they can see the inside of the house but
nothing more. But those who live in the world after having attained
Knowledge and realized God, are like people living in a glass house.
They see the inside of the room and also all that is outside. The light
from the sun of Knowledge enters strongly into the room. They perceive
everything inside the room very clearly. They know what is good and what
is bad, what is permanent and what is impermanent.</p>
<p>\"God alone is the Doer, and we are all His instruments. Therefore it is
impossible even for a Jnāni to be egotistic. The writer of a hymn to
Śiva felt proud of his achievement; but his pride was dashed to pieces
when</p>
<p>Śiva\'s bull bared his teeth. He saw that each tooth was a word of the
hymn. Do you understand the meaning of this? These words had existed
from the beginning less past. The writer had only discovered them.</p>
<p>\"It is not good to be a guru by profession. One cannot be a teacher
without a command from God. He who says he is a guru is a man of mean
intelligence. Haven\'t you seen a balance? The lighter side goes higher.
He who is spiritually higher than others does not consider himself a
guru. Everyone wants to be a teacher, but a disciple is hard to find.\"</p>
<p>Trailokya was seated on the floor, to the north of the small couch. He
was going to sing. Sri Ramakrishna said to him, \"Ah, how sweetly you
sing!\"</p>
<p>Trailokya sang to the accompaniment of a Tānpura:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I have joined my heart to Thee: all that exists art Thou;</em></p>
<p><em>Thee only have I found, for Thou art all that exists.</em></p>
<p><em>O Lord, Beloved of my heart! Thou art the Home of all;</em></p>
<p><em>Where indeed is the heart in which Thou dost not dwell?</em></p>
<p><em>Thou hast entered every heart: all that exists art Thou.</em></p>
<p><em>Whether sage or fool, whether Hindu or Mussalman,</em></p>
<p><em>Thou makest them as Thou wilt: all that exists art Thou.</em></p>
<p><em>Thy presence is everywhere, whether in heaven or in Kaaba;</em></p>
<p><em>Before Thee all must bow, for Thou art all that exists.</em></p>
<p><em>From earth below to the highest heaven, from heaven to deepest
earth,</em></p>
<p><em>I see Thee wherever I look: all that exists art Thou. Pondering, I
have understood; I have seen it beyond a doubt; I find not a single
thing that may be compared to Thee. To Jafar it has been revealed that
Thou art all that exists.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He sang again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Thou art my All in All, O lord! the Life of my life, the Essence of
essence;</em></p>
<p><em>In the three worlds I have none else but Thee to call my own.</em></p>
<p><em>Thou art my peace, my joy, my hope;</em></p>
<p><em>Thou my support, my wealth, my glory;</em></p>
<p><em>Thou art my wisdom and my strength.</em></p>
<p><em>Thou art my home, my place of rest; my dearest friend, my next of
kin;</em></p>
<p><em>My present and my future,</em></p>
<p><em>Thou; my heaven and my salvation.</em></p>
<p><em>Thou art my scriptures, my commandments;</em></p>
<p><em>Thou art my ever gracious Guru;</em></p>
<p><em>Thou the Spring of my boundless bliss.</em></p>
<p><em>Thou art the Way, and Thou the Goal;</em></p>
<p><em>Thou the Adorable One, O Lord!</em></p>
<p><em>Thou art the Mother tender-hearted;</em></p>
<p><em>Thou the chastising Father;</em></p>
<p><em>Thou the Creator and Protector;</em></p>
<p><em>Thou the Helmsman who dost steer</em></p>
<p><em>My craft across the sea of life.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While Sri Ramakrishna listened to the songs he was overwhelmed with
emotion. Again and again he said: \"Ah, Thou art all! Ah me! Ah me!\"</p>
<p>\"The music was over. It was six o\'clock in the evening. Sri
Ramakrishna went to the pine-grove, M.</p>
<p>accompanying him. Sri Ramakrishna was laughing and talking.</p>
<p>Suddenly he said to M.: \"Why haven\'t you eaten any refreshments? Why
haven\'t the others eaten either?\" He was eager for the devotees to
take some refreshments.</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna was to go to Calcutta in the evening. While returning
from the pine-grove he said to M., \"I don\'t know who will take me to
Calcutta in his carriage.\"</p>
<p>It was evening. A lamp was lighted in Sri Ramakrishna\'s room and
incense was burnt. Lamps also were lighted in the different temples and
buildings. The orchestra was playing in the Nahabat. Soon the evening
service would begin in the temples.</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna sat on the small couch. After chanting the names of the
different deities, he meditated on the Divine Mother. The evening
service was over. Sri Ramakrishna paced the room, now and then talking
to the devotees. He also consulted M. about his going to Calcutta.</p>
<p>Presently Narendra arrived. He was accompanied by Sarat and one or two
other young devotees. They all saluted the Master.</p>
<p>At the sight of Narendra Sri Ramakrishna\'s love overflowed. He tenderly
touched Narendra\'s chin as one touches a baby\'s to show one\'s love.
He said in a loving voice, \"Ah, you have come!\"</p>
<p>The Master was standing in his room, facing the Ganges. Narendra and his
young friends were talking to him, facing the east. The Master turned
toward M. and said: \"Narendra has come. How can I go to Calcutta now? I
sent for Narendra. How can I go now? What do you think?\"</p>
<p>M: \"As you wish, sir. Let us put it off today.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"All right. We shall go tomorrow, either by boat or by
carriage. (To the other devotees) It is late. Go home now.\"</p>
<p>One by one the devotees saluted him and departed.</p>
