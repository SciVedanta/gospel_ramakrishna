<p><strong>FOREWORD</strong></p>
<p>by <em>Aldous Huxley</em></p>
<p>IN THE HISTORY of the arts, genius is a thing of very rare occurrence.
Rarer still, however, are the competent reporters and recorders of that
genius. The world has had many hundreds of admirable poets and
philosophers; but of these hundreds only a very few have had the fortune
to attract a Boswell or an Eckermann.</p>
<p>When we leave the field of art for that of spiritual religion, the
scarcity of competent reporters becomes even more strongly marked. Of
the day-to-day life of the great theocentric saints and contemplatives
we know, in the great majority of cases, nothing whatever. Many, it is
true, have recorded their doctrines in writing, and a few, such as St.
Augustine, Suso and St. Teresa, have left us autobiographies of the
greatest value. But, all doctrinal writing is in some measure formal and
impersonal, while the autobiographer tends to omit what he regards as
trifling matters and suffers from the further disadvantage of being
unable to say how he strikes other people and in what way he affects
their lives. Moreover, most saints have left neither writings nor
self-portraits, and for knowledge of their lives, their characters and
their teachings, we are forced to rely upon the records made by their
disciples who, in most cases, have proved themselves singularly
incompetent as reporters and biographers. Hence the special interest
attaching to this enormously detailed account of the daily life and
conversations of Sri Ramakrishna.</p>
<p>\"M\", as the author modestly styles himself, was peculiarly qualified
for his task. To a reverent love for his master, to a deep and
experiential knowledge of that master\'s teaching, he added a prodigious
memory for the small happenings of each day and a happy gift for
recording them in an interesting and realistic way. Making good use of
his natural gifts and of the circumstances in which he found himself,
\"M\" produced a book unique, so far as my knowledge goes, in the
literature of hagiography. No other saint has had so able and
indefatigable a Boswell. Never have the small events of a
contemplative\'s daily life been described with such a wealth of
intimate detail. Never have the casual and unstudied utterances of a
great religious teacher been set down with so minute a fidelity. To
Western readers, it is true, this fidelity and this wealth of detail are
sometimes a trifle disconcerting; for the social, religious and
intellectual frames of reference within which Sri Ramakrishna did his
thinking and expressed his feelings were entirely Indian. But after the
first few surprises and bewilderments, we begin to find something
peculiarly stimulating and instructive about the very strangeness and,
to our eyes, the eccentricity of the man revealed to us in \"M\'s\"
narrative. What a scholastic philosopher would call the \"accidents\" of
Ramakrishna\'s life were intensely Hindu and therefore, so far as we in
the West are concerned, unfamiliar and hard to understand; its
\"essence\", however, was intensely mystical and therefore universal. To
read through these conversations in which mystical doctrine alternates
with an unfamiliar kind of humour, and where discussions of the oddest
aspects of Hindu mythology give place to the most profound and subtle
utterances about the nature of Ultimate Reality, is in itself a liberal,
education in humility, tolerance and suspense of judgment. We must be
grateful to the translator for his excellent version of a book so
curious and delightful as a biographical document, so precious, at the
same time, for what it teaches us of the life of the spirit.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>PREFACE</strong></p>
<p>by Swāmi Nikhilānanda</p>
<p>The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna is the English translation of the <em>Sri Sri
Rāmakrishna Kathāmrita,</em> the conversations of Sri Ramakrishna with his
disciples, devotees, and visitors, recorded by Mahendranāth Gupta, who
wrote the book under the pseudonym of \"M.\" The conversations in
Bengali fill five volumes, the first of which was published in 1897 and
the last shortly after M.\'s death in 1932. Sri Ramakrishna Math,
Madras, has published in two volumes an English translation of selected
chapters from the monumental Bengali work. I have consulted these while
preparing my translation.</p>
<p>M., one of the intimate disciples of Sri Ramakrishna, was present during
all the conversations recorded in the main body of the book and noted
them down in his diary. They therefore have the value of almost
stenographic records. In Appendix A are given several conversations
which took place in the absence of M., but of which he received a
first-hand record from persons concerned. The conversations will bring
before the reader\'s mind an intimate picture of the Master\'s eventful
life from March 1882 to April 24, 1886, only a few months before his
passing away. During this period he came in contact chiefly with
English-educated Bengālis; from among them he selected his disciples and
the bearers of his message, and with them he shared his rich spiritual
experiences.</p>
<p>I have made a literal translation, omitting only a few pages of no
particular interest to English-speaking readers. Often literary grace
has been sacrificed for the sake of literal translation. No translation
can do full justice to the original. This difficulty is all the more
felt in the present work, whose contents are of a deep mystical nature
and describe the inner experiences of a great seer. Human language is an
altogether inadequate vehicle to express supersensuous perception. Sri
Ramakrishna was almost illiterate. He never clothed his thoughts in
formal language. His words sought to convey his direct realization of
Truth. His conversation was in a village patois. Therein lies its charm.
In order to explain to his listeners an abstruse philosophy, he, like
Christ before him, used with telling effect homely parables and
illustrations, culled from his observation of the daily life around him.</p>
<p>The reader will find mentioned in this work many visions and experiences
that fall outside the ken of physical science and even psychology. With
the development of modern knowledge the border line between the natural
and the supernatural is ever shifting its position. Genuine mystical
experiences are not as suspect now as they were half a century ago. The
words of Sri Ramakrishna have already exerted a tremendous influence in
the land of his birth. Savants of Europe have found in his words the
ring of universal truth.</p>
<p>But these words were not the product of intellectual cogitation; they
were rooted in direct experience. Hence, to students of religion,
psychology, and physical science, these experiences of the Master are of
immense value for the understanding of religious phenomena in general.
No doubt Sri Ramakrishna was a Hindu of the Hindus; yet his experiences
transcended the limits of the dogmas and creeds of Hinduism. Mystics of
religions other than Hinduism will find in Sri Ramakrishna\'s
experiences a corroboration of the experiences of their own prophets and
seers. And this is very important today for the resuscitation of
religious values. The sceptical reader may pass by the supernatural
experiences; he will yet find in the book enough material to provoke his
serious thought and solve many of his spiritual problems.</p>
<p>There are repetitions of teachings and parables in the book. I have kept
them purposely. They have their charm and usefulness, repeated as they
were in different settings. Repetition is unavoidable in a work of this
kind. In the first place, different seekers come to a religious teacher
with questions of more or less identical nature; hence the answers will
be of more or less identical pattern. Besides, religious teachers of all
times and climes have tried, by means of repetition, to hammer truths
into the stony soil of the recalcitrant human mind. Finally, repetition
does not seem tedious if the ideas repeated are dear to a man\'s heart.</p>
<p>I have thought it necessary to write a rather lengthy Introduction to
the book. In it I have given the</p>
<p>biography of the Master, descriptions of people who came in contact with
him, short explanations of several systems of Indian religious thought
intimately connected with Sri Ramakrishna\'s life, and other relevant
matters which, I hope, will enable the reader better to understand and
appreciate the unusual contents of this book. It is particularly
important that the Western reader, unacquainted with Hindu religious
thought, should first read carefully the introductory chapter, in order
that he may fully enjoy these conversations. Many Indian terms and names
have been retained in the book for want of suitable English equivalents.
Their meaning is given either in the Glossary or in the foot-notes. The
Glossary also gives explanations of a number of expressions unfamiliar
to Western readers. The diacritical marks are explained under Notes on
Pronunciation.</p>
<p>In the Introduction I have drawn much material from the Life of Sri
Ramakrishna, published by the Advaita Ashrama, Māyāvati, India. I have
also consulted the excellent article on Sri Ramakrishna by Swami
Nirvedānanda, in the second volume of the Cultural Heritage of India.</p>
<p>The book contains many songs sung either by the Master or by the
devotees. These form an important feature of the spiritual tradition of
Bengal and were for the most part written by men of mystical experience.
For giving the songs their present form I am grateful to Mr. John
Moffitt, Jr.</p>
<p>In the preparation of this manuscript I have received ungrudging help
from several friends. Miss Margaret Woodrow Wilson and Mr.Joseph
Campbell have worked hard in editing my translation. Mrs.Elizabeth
Davidson has typed, more than once, the entire manuscript and rendered
other valuable help. Mr.Aldous Huxley has laid me under a debt of
gratitude by writing the Foreword. I sincerely thank them all.</p>
<p>In the spiritual firmament Sri Ramakrishna is a waxing crescent. Within
one hundred years of his birth and fifty years of his death his message
has spread across land and sea. Romain Rolland has described him as the
fulfilment of the spiritual aspirations of the three hundred millions of
Hindus for the last two thousand years. Mahatma Gandhi has written:
\"His life enables us to see God face to face. . . . Ramakrishna was a
living embodiment of godliness.\" He is being recognized as a compeer of
Krishna, Buddha, and Christ.</p>
<p>The life and teachings of Sri Ramakrishna have redirected the thoughts
of the denationalized Hindus to the spiritual ideals of their
forefathers. During the latter part of the nineteenth century his was
the time-honoured role of the Saviour of the Eternal Religion of the
Hindus. His teachings played an important part in liberalizing the minds
of orthodox pundits and hermits. Even now he is the silent force that is
moulding the spiritual destiny of India. His great disciple, Swami
Vivekananda, was the first Hindu missionary to preach the message of
Indian culture to the enlightened minds of Europe and America. The full
consequence of Swami Vivekānandā work is still in the womb of the
future.</p>
<p>May this translation of the first book of its kind in the religious
history of the world, being the record of the direct words of a prophet,
help stricken humanity to come nearer to the Eternal Verity of life and
remove dissension and quarrel from among the different faiths! May it
enable seekers of Truth to grasp the subtle laws of the supersensuous
realm, and unfold before man\'s restricted vision the spiritual
foundation of the universe, the unity of existence, and the divinity of
the soul!</p>

<p><em>The Recorder of the Gospel</em></p>
<p><strong>MAHENDRANĀTH GUPTA</strong></p>
<p>In the life of the great Saviours and Prophets of the world it is often
found that they are accompanied by souls of high spiritual potency who
play a conspicuous part in the furtherance of their Master\'s mission.
They become so integral a part of the life and work of these great ones
that posterity can think of them only in mutual association. Such is the
case with Sri Ramakrishna and M., whose diary has come to be known to
the world as</p>
<p>the <em>Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna</em> in English and as <em>Sri Rāmakrishna
Kathāmrita</em> in the original Bengali</p>
<p>version.</p>
<p>Sri Mahendra Nath Gupta, familiary known to the readers of the Gospel by
his pen name M., and to the devotees as Master Mahashay, was born on the
14th of July, 1854 as the son of Madhusudan Gupta, an officer of the
Calcutta High Court, and his wife, Swarnamayi Devi. He had a brilliant
scholastic career at Hare School and the Presidency College at Calcutta.
The range of his studies included the best that both occidental and
oriental learning had to offer. English literature, history, economics,
western philosophy and law on the one hand, and Sanskrit literature and
grammar, Darsanas, Puranas, Smritis, Jainism, Buddhism, astrology and
Ayurveda on the other were the subjects in which he attained
considerable proficiency.</p>
<p>He was an educationist all his life both in a spiritual and in a secular
sense. After he passed out of College, he took up work as headmaster in
a number of schools in succession Narail High School, City School, Ripon
College School, Metropolitan School, Aryan School, Oriental School,
Oriental Seminary and Model School. The causes of his migration from
school to school were that he could not get on with some of the
managements on grounds of principles and that often his spiritual mood
drew him away to places of pilgrimage for long periods. He worked with
some of the most noted public men of the time like Iswar Chandra
Vidyāsāgar and Surendranath Banerjee. The latter appointed him as a
professor in the City and Ripon Colleges where he taught subjects like
English, philosophy, history and economics. In his later days he took
over the Morton School, and he spent his time in the staircase room of
the third floor of it, administering the school and preaching the
message of the Master. He was much respected in educational circles
where he was usually referred to as Rector Mahashay. A teacher who had
worked under him writes thus in warm appreciation of his teaching
methods: \"Only when I worked with him in school could I appreciate what
a great educationist he was. He would come down to the level of his
students when teaching, though he himself was so learned, so talented.
Ordinarily teachers confine their instruction to what is given in books
without much thought as to whether the student can accept it or not. But
M., would first of all gauge how much the student could take in and by
what means. He would employ aids to teaching like maps, pictures and
diagrams, so that his students could learn by seeing. Thirty years ago
(from 1953) when the question of imparting education through the medium
of the mother tongue was being discussed, M. had already employed
Bengali as the medium of instruction in the Morton School.\" (M <em>The
Apostle and the Evangelist</em> by Swami Nityatmananda Part I. P. 15.)</p>
<p>Imparting secular education was, however, only his profession ; his main
concern was with the spiritual regeneration of man a calling for which
Destiny seems to have chosen him. From his childhood he was deeply
pious, and he used to be moved very much by Sādhus, temples and Durga
Puja celebrations. The piety and eloquence of the great Brahmo leader of
the times, Keshab Chander Sen, elicited a powerful response from the
impressionable mind of Mahendra Nath, as it did in the case of many an
idealistic young man of Calcutta, and prepared him to receive the great
Light that was to dawn on him with the coming of Sri Ramakrishna into
his life.</p>
<p>This epoch-making event of his life came about in a very strange way. M.
belonged to a joint family with several collateral members. Some ten
years after he began his career as an educationist, bitter quarrels
broke out among the members of the family, driving the sensitive M. to
despair and utter despondency. He lost all interest in life and left
home one night to go into the wide world with the idea of ending his
life. At dead of night he took rest in his sister\'s house at Baranagar,
and in the morning, accompanied by a nephew</p>
<p>Siddheswar, he wandered from one garden to another in Calcutta until
Siddheswar brought him to the Temple Garden of Dakshineswar where Sri
Ramakrishna was then living. After spending some time in the beautiful
rose gardens there, he was directed to the room of the Paramahamsa,
where the eventful meeting of the Master and the disciple took place on
a blessed evening (the exact date is not on record) on a Sunday in March
1882. As regards what took place on the occasion, the reader is referred
to the opening section of the first chapter of</p>
<p>the <em>Gospel</em>.</p>
<p>The Master, who divined the mood of desperation in M, his resolve to
take leave of this \'play-field of deception\', put new faith and hope
into him by his gracious words of assurance: \"God forbid! Why should
you take leave of this world? Do you not feel blessed by discovering
your Guru? By His grace, what is beyond all imagination or dreams can be
easily achieved!\" At these words the clouds of despair moved away from
the horizon of M.\'s mind, and the sunshine of a new hope revealed to
him fresh vistas of meaning in life. Referring to this phase of his
life, M. used to say, \"Behold! where is the resolve to end life, and
where, the discovery of God! That is, sorrow should be looked upon as a
friend of man. God is all good.\" (<em>Ibid</em> P.33.)</p>
<p>After this re-settlement, M\'s life revolved around the Master, though
he continued his professional work as an educationist. During all
holidays, including Sundays, he spent his time at Dakshineswar in the
Master\'s company, and at times extended his stay to several days.</p>
<p>It did not take much time for M. to become very intimate with the
Master, or for the Master to recognise in this disciple a divinely
commissioned partner in the fulfilment of his spiritual mission. When M.
was reading out the Chaitanya Bhagavata, the Master discovered that he
had been, in a previous birth, a disciple and companion of the great
Vaishnava Teacher, Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, and the Master even saw him
\'with his naked eye\' participating in the ecstatic mass-singing of the
Lord\'s name under the leadership of that Divine personality. So the
Master told M, \"You are my own, of the same substance as the father and
the son,\" indicating thereby that M. was one of the chosen few and a
part and parcel of his Divine mission.</p>
<p>There was an urge in M. to abandon the household life and become a
Sannyāsin. When he communicated this idea to the Master, he forbade him
saying,\" Mother has told me that you have to do a little of Her work
you will have to teach Bhagavata, the word of God to humanity. The
Mother keeps a Bhagavata Pandit with a bondage in the world!\" (<em>Ibid</em>
P.36.)</p>
<p>An appropriate allusion indeed! Bhagavata, the great scripture that has
given the word of Sri Krishna to mankind, was composed by the Sage Vyāsa
under similar circumstances. When caught up in a mood of depression like
that of M, Vyāsa was advised by the sage Nārada that he would gain peace
of mind only qn composing a work exclusively devoted to the depiction of
the Lord\'s glorious attributes and His teachings on Knowledge and
Devotion, and the result was that the world got from Vyāsa the
invaluable gift of the</p>
<p>Bhagavata Purana depicting the life and teachings of Sri Krishna. From
the mental depression of the modem Vyāsa, the world has obtained the
<em>Kathāmrita</em> (Bengali Edition) the <em>Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna</em> in
English.</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna was a teacher for both the Orders of mankind, Sannyāsins
and householders. His own life offered an ideal example for both, and he
left behind disciples who followed the highest traditions he had set in
respect of both these ways of life. M., along with Nag Mahashay,
exemplified how a householder can rise to the highest level of sagehood.
M. was married to Nikunja Devi, a distant relative of Keshab Chander
Sen, even when he was reading at College, and he had four children, two
sons and two daughters. The responsibility of the family, no doubt, made
him dependent on his professional income, but the great devotee that he
was, he never compromised with ideals and principles for this reason.
Once when he was working as the headmaster in</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>school managed by the great Vidyāsāgar, the results of the school at
    the public examination happened to be rather poor, and Vidyāsāgar
    attributed it to M\'s pre-occupation with the Master and his
    consequent failure to attend adequately to the school work. M. at
    once resigned his post without any thought of the morrow. Within a
    fortnight the family was in poverty, and M. was one day pacing up
    and down the verandah of his house,</p>
<p>Nityatmananda vol. I. P. 40.)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>musing how he would feed his children the next day. Just then a man came
with a letter addressed to \'Mahendra Babu\', and on opening it, M.
found that it was a letter from his friend Sri Surendra Nath Banerjee,
asking whether he would like to take up a professorship in the Ripon
College. In this way three or four times he gave up the job that gave
him the wherewithal to support the family, either for upholding
principles or for practising spiritual Sadhanas in holy places, without
any consideration of the possible dire worldly consequences; but he was
always able to get over these difficulties somehow, and the interests of
his family never suffered. In spite of his disregard for worldly goods,
he was, towards the latter part of his life, in a fairly flourishing
condition as the proprietor of the Morton School which he developed into
a noted educational institution in the city. The Lord has said in the
Bhagavad Gitā that in the case of those who think of nothing except Him,
He Himself would take up all their material and spiritual
responsibilities. M. was an example of the truth of the Lord\'s promise.</p>
<p>Though his children received proper attention from him, his real family,
both during the Master\'s life-time and after, consisted of saints,
devotees, Sannyāsins and spiritual aspirants. His life exemplifies the
Master\'s teaching that an ideal householder must be like a good
maid-servant of a family, loving and caring properly for the children of
the house, but knowing always that her real home and children are
elsewhere. During the Master\'s life-time he spent all his Sundays and
other holidays with him and his devotees, and besides listening to the
holy talks and devotional music, practised meditation both on the
Personal and the Impersonal aspects of God under the direct guidance of
the Master. In the pages of the Gospel the reader gets a picture of
M.\'s spiritual relationship with the Master how from a hazy belief in
the Impersonal God of the Brahmos, he was step by step brought to accept
both Personality and Impersonality as the two aspects of the same
Non-dual Being, how he was convinced of the manifestation of that Being
as Gods, Goddesses and as Incarnations, and how he was established in a
life that was both of a Jnāni and of a Bhakta. This Jnāni-Bhakta outlook
and way of living became so dominant a feature of his life that Swami
Raghavananda, who was very closely associated with him during his last
six years, remarks: \"Among those who lived with M. in latter days, some
felt that he always lived in this constant and conscious union with God
even with open eyes (i.e., even in waking</p>
<p>consciousness).\" (Swami Raghavananda\'s article on M. in <em>Prabuddha
Bharata</em> vol. XXXVII. P. 442.)</p>
<p>Besides undergoing spiritual disciplines at the feet of the Master, M.
used to go to holy places during the Master\'s life-time itself and
afterwards too as a part of his <em>Sādhanā</em>. He was one of the earliest of
the</p>
<p>disciples to visit Kamarpukur, the birthplace of the Master, in the
latter\'s life-time itself; for he wished to practise contemplation on
the Master\'s early life in its true original setting. His experience
there is described as follows by Swami Nityatmananda: \"By the grace of
the Master, he saw the entire Kamarpukur as a holy place bathed in an
effulgent Light. Trees and creepers, beasts and birds and men all were
made of effulgence. So he</p>
<p>prostrated to all on the road. He saw a torn cat, which appeared to him
luminous with the Light of Consciousness. Immediately he fell to the
ground and saluted it\" (M <em>The Apostle and the Evangelist</em> by Swami</p>
<p>He had similar experience in Dakshineswar also. At the instance of the
Master he also visited Puri, and in the words of Swami Nityatmananda,
\"with indomitable courage, M. embraced the image of Jagannath out of
season.\"</p>
<p>The life of <em>Sādhanā</em> and holy association that he started on at the
feet of the Master, he continued all through his life. He has for this
reason been most appropriately described as a Grihastha-Sannyāsi
(householder-Sannyāsin). Though he was forbidden by the Master to become
a Sannyāsin, his reverence for the Sannyāsa ideal was whole-hearted and
was without any reservation. So after Sri Ramakrishna\'s passing away,
while several of the Master\'s householder devotees considered the young
Sannyāsin disciples of the Master as inexperienced and inconsequential,
M. stood by them with the firm faith that the Master\'s life and message
were going to be perpetuated only through them. Swami Vivekananda wrote
from America in a letter to the inmates of the Math: \"When Sri Thākur
(Master) left the body, every one gave us up as a few unripe urchins.
But M. and a few others did not leave us in the lurch. We cannot repay
our debt to them.\" (Swami</p>
<p>Raghavananda\'s article on M. in <em>Prabuddha Bharata</em> vol. XXX P. 442.)</p>
<p>M. spent his weekends and holidays with the monastic brethren who, after
the Master\'s demise, had formed themselves into an Order with a Math at
Baranagore, and participated in the intense life of devotion and
meditation that they followed. At other times he would retire to
Dakshineswar or some garden in the city and spend several days in
spiritual practice taking simple self-cooked food. In order to feel that
he was one with all mankind he often used to go out of his home at dead
of night, and like a wandering Sannyāsin, sleep with the waifs on some
open verandah or footpath on the road.</p>
<p>After the Master\'s demise, M. went on pilgrimage several times. He
visited Banāras, Vrindāvan, Ayodhyā and other places. At Banāras he
visited the famous Trailinga Swāmi and fed him with sweets, and he had
long conversations with Swami Bhaskarananda, one of the noted saintly
and scholarly Sannyāsins of the time. In 1912 he went with the Holy
Mother to Banāras, and spent about a year in the company of Sannyāsins
at Banāras, Vrindāvan, Hardwar, Hrishikesh and Swargashram. But he
returned to Calcutta, as that city offered him the unique opportunity of
associating himself with the places hallowed by the Master in his
life-time. Afterwards he does not seem to have gone to any far-off
place, but stayed on in his room in the Morton School carrying on his
spiritual ministry, speaking on the Master and his teachings to the
large number of people who flocked to him after having read his famous
<em>Kathāmrita</em> known to English readers as <em>The Gospel of Sri
Ramakrishna</em>.</p>
<p>This brings us to the circumstances that led to the writing and
publication of this monumental work, which has made M. one of the
immortals in hagiographic literature. While many educated people heard
Sri Ramakrishna\'s talks, it was given to this illustrious personage
alone to leave a graphic and exact account of them for posterity, with
details like date, hour, place, names and particulars about
participants. Humanity owes this great book to the ingrained habit of
diary-keeping with which M. was endowed. Even as a boy of about
thirteen, while he was a student in the 3rd class of the Hare School, he
was in the habit of keeping a diary. \"Today on rising,\" he wrote in
his diary, \"I greeted my father and mother, prostrating on the ground
before</p>
<p>them\" (Swami Nityatmananda\'s \'M The Apostle and the Evangelist\' Part
I. P 29.) At another place he wrote, \"Today, while on my way to school,
I visited, as usual, the temples of Kāli, the Mother at Tharitharia, and
of Mother Sitala, and paid my obeisance to them.\" About twenty-five
years after, when he met the Great Master in the spring of 1882, it was
the same instinct of a born diary-writer that made him begin his book,
\'unique in the literature of hagiography\', with the memorable words:
\"When hearing the name of Hari or Rāma once, you shed tears and your
hair stands on end, then you may know for certain that you do not have
to perform devotions such as Sandhya any more.\"</p>
<p>In addition to this instinct for diary-keeping, M. had great endowments
contributing to success in this line. Writes Swami Nityatmananda who
lived in close association with M., in his book entitled <em>M - The
Apostle and Evangelist</em>: \"M.\'s prodigious memory combined with his
extraordinary power of imagination completely</p>
<p>annihilated the distance of time and place for him. Even after the lapse
of half a century he could always visualise vividly, scenes from the
life of Sri Ramakrishna. Superb too was his power to portray pictures by
words.\"</p>
<p>Besides the prompting of his inherent instinct, the main inducement for
M. to keep this diary of his experiences at Dakshineswar was his desire
to provide himself with a means for living in holy company at all times.
Being a school teacher, he could be with the Master only on Sundays and
other holidays, and it was on his diary that he depended for \'holy
company\' on other days. The devotional scriptures like the Bhagavata
say that holy company is the first and most important means for the
generation and growth of devotion. For, in such company man could hear
talks on spiritual matters and listen to the glorification of Divine
attributes, charged with the fervour and conviction emanating from the
hearts of great lovers of God. Such company is therefore the one certain
means through which Sraddha (Faith), Rati (attachment to God) and Bhakti
(loving devotion) are generated. The diary of his visits to Dakshineswar
provided M. with material for re-living, through reading and
contemplation, the holy company he had had earlier, even on days when he
was not able to visit Dakshineswar. The wealth of details and the vivid
description of men and things in the midst of which the</p>
<p>sublime conversations are set, provide excellent material to re-live
those experiences for any one with imaginative powers. It was observed
by M.\'s disciples and admirers that in later life also whenever he was
free or alone, he would be pouring over his diary, transporting himself
on the wings of imagination to the glorious days he spent at the feet of
the Master.</p>
<p>During the Master\'s life-time M. does not seem to have revealed the
contents of his diary to any one. There is an unconfirmed tradition that
when the Master saw him taking notes, he expressed apprehension at the
possibility of his utilising these to publicise him like Keshab Sen; for
the Great Master was so full of the spirit of renunciation and humility
that he disliked being lionised. It must be for this reason that no one
knew about this precious diary of M. for a decade until he brought out
selections from it as a pamphlet in English in 1897</p>
<p>with the Holy Mother\'s blessings and permission. The Holy Mother, being
very much pleased to hear parts of the diary read to her in Bengali,
wrote to M.: \"When I heard the <em>Kathāmrita</em>, (Bengali name of the book)
I felt as if it was he, the Master, who was saying all that.\" (<em>Ibid</em>
Part I. P 37.)</p>
<p>The two pamphlets in English entitled the <em>Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna</em>
appeared in October and November 1897. They drew the spontaneous
acclamation of Swami Vivekananda, who wrote on 24th November of that
year from Dehra Dun to M.:\"Many many thanks for your second leaflet. It
is indeed wonderful. The move is quite original, and never was the life
of a Great Teacher brought before the public untarnished by the
writer\'s mind, as you are doing. The language also is beyond all
praise, so fresh, so pointed, and withal so plain and easy. I cannot
express in adequate terms how I have enjoyed them. I am really in a
transport when I read them. Strange, isn\'t it? Our Teacher and Lord was
so original, and each one of us will have to be original or nothing. I
now understand why none of us attempted His life before. It has been
reserved for you, this great</p>
<p>work. He is with you evidently.\" (<em>Vedānta Kesari</em> Vol. XIX P. 141.
Also given in the first edition of the <em>Gospel</em> published from
Ramakrishna Math, Madras in 1911.)</p>
<p>And Swamiji added a post script to the letter: \"Socratic dialogues are
Plato all over you are entirely hidden. Moreover, the dramatic part is
infinitely beautiful. Everybody likes it here or in the West.\" Indeed,
in order to be unknown, Mahendranath had used the pen-name M., under
which the book has been appearing till now. But so great a book cannot
remain obscure for long, nor can its author remain unrecognised by the
large public in these modern times. M. and his book came to be widely
known very soon and to meet the growing demand, a full-sized book, Vol.
I of the <em>Gospel</em>, translated by the author himself, was published in
1907 by the Brahmavadin Office, Madras. A second edition of it, revised
by the author, was brought out by the</p>
<p>Ramakrishna Math, Madras in December 1911, and subsequently a second
part, containing new chapters from the original Bengali, was published
by the same Math in 1922. The full English translation of the <em>Gospel</em>
by</p>
<p>Swami Nikhilananda appeared first in 1942.</p>
<p>In Bengali the book is published in five volumes, the first part having
appeared in 1902 and the others in 1905, 1907, 1910 and 1932
respectively.</p>
<p>It looks as if M. was brought to the world by the Great Master to record
his words and transmit them to posterity. Swami Sivananda, a direct
disciple of the Master and the second President of the Ramakrishna Math
and Mission, says on this topic: \"Whenever there was an interesting
talk, the Master would call Master Mahashay if he was not in the room,
and then draw his attention to the holy words spoken. We did not know
then why the Master did so. Now we can realise that this action of the
Master had an important significance,</p>
<p>for it was reserved for Master Mahashay to give to the world at large
the sayings of the Master.\" (<em>Vedānta Kesari</em> Vol. XIX P 141.) Thanks
to M., we get, unlike in the case of the great teachers of the past, a
faithful record with date, time, exact report of conversations,
description of concerned men and places, references to contemporary
events and personalities and a hundred other details for the last four
years of the Master\'s life (1882-\'86), so that no one can doubt the
historicity of the Master and his teachings at any time in the future.</p>
<p>M. was, in every respect, a true missionary of Sri Ramakrishna right
from his first acquaintance with him in</p>
<p>1882. As a school teacher, it was a practice with him to direct to the
Master such of his students as had a true spiritual disposition. Though
himself prohibited by the Master to take to monastic life, he encouraged
all spiritually inclined young men he came across in his later life to
join the monastic Order. Swami Vijnanananda, a direct Sannyāsin disciple
of the Master and a President of the Ramakrishna Order, once remarked to
M.: \"By enquiry, I have come to the conclusion that eighty percent and
more of the Sannyāsins have embraced the monastic life after reading the
<em>Kathāmrita</em> (Bengali name of the book) and coming in contact with
you.\" (<em>M The Apostle and the Evangelist</em> by Swami Nityatmananda Part
I, P 37.)</p>
<p>In 1905 he retired from the active life of a Professor and devoted his
remaining twenty-seven years exclusively to the preaching of the life
and message of the Great Master. He bought the Morton Institution from
its original proprietors and shifted it to a commodious four-storeyed
house at 50 Amherst Street, where it flourished under his management as
one of the most efficient educational institutions in Calcutta. He
generally occupied a staircase room at the top of it, cooking his own
meal which consisted only of milk and rice without variation, and
attended to all his personal needs himself. His dress also was the
simplest possible. It was his conviction that limitation of personal
wants to the minimum is an important aid to holy living. About one hour
in the morning he would spend in inspecting the classes of the school,
and then retire to his staircase room to pour over his diary and live in
the divine atmosphere of the earthly days of the Great Master, unless
devotees and admirers had already gathered in his room seeking his holy
company.</p>
<p>In appearance, M. looked a Vedic Rishi. Tall and stately in bearing, he
had a strong and well-built body, an unusually broad chest, high
forehead and arms extending to the knees. His complexion was fair and
his prominent eyes were always tinged with the expression of the divine
love that filled his heart. Adorned with a silvery beard that flowed
luxuriantly down his chest, and a shining face radiating the serenity
and gravity of holiness, M. was as imposing and majestic as he was
handsome and engaging in appearance. Humorous, sweet-tongued and
eloquent when situations required, this great Maharishi of our age lived
only to sing the glory of Sri Ramakrishna day and night. Though a very
well versed scholar in the Upanishads, Gitā and the philosophies of the
East and the West, all his discussions and teachings found their
culmination in the life and the message of Sri Ramakrishna, in which he
found the real explanation and illustration of all the scriptures. Both
consciously and unconsciously, he was the teacher of the <em>Kathāmrita</em>
the nectarine words of the Great Master.</p>
<p>Though a much-sought-after spiritual guide, an educationist of repute,
and a contemporary and close associate of illustrious personages like
Sri Ramakrishna, Swami Vivekananda, Keshab Chander Sen and Iswar Chander
Vidyāsāgar, he was always moved by the noble humanity of a lover of God,
which consists in respecting the personalities of all as receptacles of
the Divine Spirit. So he taught without the consciousness of a teacher,
and no bar of superiority stood in the way of his doing the humblest
service to his students and devotees. \"He was a commission of love,\"
writes his close devotee, Swami Raghavananda, \"and yet his soft and
sweet words would pierce the stoniest heart, make the worldly-minded
weep and repent and turn Godwards.\" (<em>Prabuddha Bharata</em> Vol. XXXVII P
499.)</p>
<p>As time went on and the number of devotees increased, the staircase room
and terrace of the 3rd floor of the Morton Institution became a
veritable Naimisaranya of modern times, resounding during all hours of
the day, and sometimes of night, too, with the word of God coming from
the Rishi-like face of M. addressed to the eager God-seekers sitting
around. To the devotees who helped him in preparing the text of the
<em>Gospel</em>, he would dictate the conversations of the Master in a
meditative mood, referring now and then to his diary. At</p>
<p>times in the stillness of midnight he would awaken a nearby devotee and
tell him: \"Let us listen to the words of the Master in the depths of
the night as he explains the truth of the Pranava.\" (<em>Vedānta Kesari</em>
XIX P. 142.)</p>
<p>Swami Raghavananda, an intimate devotee of M., writes as follows about
these devotional sittings: \"In the sweet and warm months of April and
May, sitting under the canopy of heaven on the roof-garden of 50 Amherst
Street, surrounded by shrubs and plants, himself sitting in their midst
like a Rishi of old, the stars and planets in their courses beckoning us
to things infinite and sublime, he would speak to us of the mysteries of
God and His love and of the yearning that would rise in the human heart
to solve the Eternal Riddle, as</p>
<p>--------------------</p>
<p><em>\'Gurudeva-Ma, Kole tule na-o</em></p>
<p>exemplified in the life of his Master. The mind, melting under the
influence of his soft sweet words of light, would almost transcend the
frontiers of limited existence and dare to peep into the infinite. He
himself would take the influence of the setting and say,\'What a blessed
privilege it is to sit in such a setting (pointing to the starry
heavens), in the company of the devotees discoursing on God and His
love!\' These unforgettable scenes will long remain imprinted on the
minds of his hearers.\" (Prabuddha Bharata Vol XXXVII P 497.)</p>
<p>About twenty-seven years of his life he spent in this way in the heart
of the great city of Calcutta, radiating</p>
<p>the Master\'s thoughts and ideals to countless devotees who flocked to
him, and to still larger numbers who read his <em>Kathāmrita</em> (English
Edition : <em>The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna)</em>, the last part of which he
had</p>
<p>completed before June 1932 and given to the press. And miraculously, as
it were, his end also came immediately after he had completed his
life\'s mission. About three months earlier he had come to stay at his
home at 13/2 Gurdasprasad Chaudhuary Lane at Thakur Bari, where the Holy
Mother had herself installed the</p>
<p>Master and where His regular worship was being conducted for the
previous 40 years. The night of 3rd June being the <em>Phalahārini Kāli
Pooja</em> day, M. had sent his devotees who used to keep company with him,
to</p>
<p>attend the special worship at Belur Math at night. After attending the
service at the home shrine, he went through the proof of the
<em>Kathāmrita</em> for an hour. Suddenly he got a severe attack of neuralgic
pain, from</p>
<p>which he had been suffering now and then, of late. Before 6 a.m. in the
early hours of <strong>4th June 1932</strong> he</p>
<p>passed away, fully conscious and chanting: (Take me in your arms! O</p>
<p>Master! O Mother!!)\'</p>

<p><em>March 1974.</em></p>
<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p><em>by Swāmi Nikhilānanda</em></p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna, the God-man of modern India, was born at Kāmārpukur.
This village in the Hooghly District preserved during the last century
the idyllic simplicity of the rural areas of Bengāl. Situated far from
the railway, it was untouched by the glamour of the city. It contained
rice-fields, tall palms, royal banyans, a few lakes, and two cremation
grounds. South of the village a stream took its leisurely course. A
mango orchard dedicated by a neighbouring zamindār to the public use was
frequented by the boys for their noonday sports. A highway passed
through the village to the great temple of Jagannāth at Puri, and the
villagers, most of whom were farmers and craftsmen, entertained many
passing holy men and pilgrims. The dull round of the rural life was
broken by lively festivals, the observance of sacred days, religious
singing, and other innocent pleasures.</p>
<p>About his parents Sri Ramakrishna once said: \"My mother was the
personification of rectitude and gentleness. She did not know much about
the ways of the world; innocent of the art of concealment, she would say
what was in her mind. People loved her for open-heartedness. My father,
an orthodox brāhmin, never accepted gifts from the Śudrās. He spent much
of his time in worship and meditation, and in repeating God\'s name and
chanting His glories. Whenever in his daily prayers he invoked the
Goddess Gāyatri, his chest flushed and tears rolled down his cheeks. He
spent his leisure hours making garlands for the Family Deity,
Raghuvir.\"</p>
<p>Khudirām Chattopādhyāya and Chandra Devi, the parents of Sri
Ramakrishna, were married in 1799. At that time Khudirām was living in
his ancestral village of Derepore, not far from Kāmārpukur. Their first
son, Rāmkumār, was born in 1805, and their first daughter, Kātyāyani, in
1810. In 1814 Khudirām was ordered by his landlord to bear false witness
in court against a neighbour. When he refused to do so, the landlord
brought a false case against him and deprived him of his ancestral
property. Thus dispossessed, he arrived, at the invitation of another
landlord, in the quiet village of Kāmārpukur, where he was given a
dwelling and about an acre of fertile land. The crops from this little
property were enough to meet his family\'s simple needs. Here he lived
in simplicity, dignity, and contentment.</p>
<p>Ten years after his coming to Kāmārpukur, Khudirām made a pilgrimage on
foot to Rāmeswar, at the southern extremity of India. Two years later
was born his second son, whom he named Rāmeśwar. Again in 1835, at the
age of sixty, he made a pilgrimage, this time to Gayā. Here, from
ancient times, Hindus have come from the four corners of India to
discharge their duties to their departed ancestors by offering them food
and drink at the sacred footprint of the Lord Vishnu. At this holy place
Khudirām had a dream in which the Lord Vishnu promised to be born as his
son. And Chandrā Devi, too, in front of the Śiva temple at Kāmārpukur,
had a vision indicating the birth of a divine child. Upon his return the
husband found that she had conceived.</p>
<p>It was on February 18, 1836, that the child, to be known afterwards as
Ramakrishna, was born. In memory of the dream at Gayā he was given the
name of Gadādhar, the \"Bearer of the Mace\", an epithet of Vishnu.
Three years later a little sister was born.</p>
<p><strong>Boyhood</strong></p>
<p>Gadādhar grew up into a healthy and restless boy, full of fun and sweet
mischief. He was intelligent and precocious and endowed with a
prodigious memory. On his father\'s lap he learnt by heart the names of
his ancestors and the hymns to the gods and goddesses, and at the
village school he was taught to read and write. But his greatest delight
was to listen to recitations of stories from Hindu mythology and the
epics. These he would afterwards recount from memory, to the great joy
of the villagers. Painting he enjoyed; the art of moulding images of the
gods and goddesses he learnt from the potters. But arithmetic was his
great aversion.</p>
<p>At the age of six or seven Gadādhar had his first experience of
spiritual ecstasy. One day in June or July, when he was walking along a
narrow path between paddy-fields, eating the puffed rice that he carried
in a basket, he looked up at the sky and saw a beautiful, dark
thunder-cloud. As it spread, rapidly enveloping the whole</p>
<p>sky, a flight of snow-white cranes passed in front of it. The beauty of
the contrast overwhelmed the boy. He fell to the ground, unconscious,
and the puffed rice went in all directions. Some villagers found him and
carried him home in their arms. Gadādhar said later that in that state
he had experienced an indescribable joy.</p>
<p>Gadādhar was seven years old when his father died. This incident
profoundly affected him. For the first time the boy realized that life
on earth was impermanent. Unobserved by others, he began to slip into
the mango orchard or into one of the cremation grounds, and he spent
hours absorbed in his own thoughts. He also became more helpful to his
mother in the discharge of her household duties. He gave more attention
to reading and hearing the religious stories recorded in the Purānās.
And he became interested in the wandering monks and pious pilgrims who
would stop at Kāmārpukur on their way to Puri. These holy men, the
custodians of India\'s spiritual heritage and the living witnesses of
the ideal of renunciation of the world and all-absorbing love of God,
entertained the little boy with stories from the Hindu epics, stories of
saints and prophets, and also stories of their own adventures. He, on
his part, fetched their water and fuel and served them in various ways.
Meanwhile, he was observing their meditation and worship.</p>
<p>At the age of nine, Gadādhar was invested with the <em>Sacred Thread.</em> This
ceremony conferred upon him the privileges of his brāhmin lineage,
including the worship of the Family Deity, Raghuvir, and imposed upon
him the many strict disciplines of a brāhmin\'s life. During the
ceremony of investiture he shocked his relatives by accepting a meal
cooked by his nurse, a Śudrā woman. His father would never have dreamt
of doing such a thing. But in a playful mood Gadādhar had once promised
this woman that he would eat her food, and now he fulfilled his plighted
word. The woman had piety and religious sincerity, and these were more
important to the boy than the conventions of society.</p>
<p>Gadādhar was now permitted to worship Raghuvir. Thus began his first
training in meditation. He so gave his heart and soul to the worship
that the stone image very soon appeared to him as the living Lord of the
Universe. His tendency to lose himself in contemplation was first
noticed at this time. Behind his boyish light-heartedness was seen a
deepening of his spiritual nature.</p>
<p>About this time, on the Śivarātri night, consecrated to the worship of
Śiva, a dramatic performance was arranged. The principal actor, who was
to play the part of Śiva, suddenly fell ill, and Gadādhar was persuaded
to act in his place. While friends were dressing him for the role of
Śiva - smearing his body with ashes, matting his locks, placing a
trident in his hand and a string of rudrākaśa beads around his neck -
the boy appeared to become absent-minded. He approached the stage with
slow and measured step, supported by his friends. He looked the living
image of Śiva. The audience loudly applauded what it took to be his
skill as an actor, but it was soon discovered that he was really lost in
meditation. His countenance was radiant and tears flowed from his eyes.
He was lost to the outer world. The effect of this scene on the audience
was tremendous. The people felt blessed as by a vision of Śiva Himself.
The performance had to be stopped, and the boy\'s mood lasted till the
following morning.</p>
<p>Gadādhar himself now organized a dramatic company with his young
friends. The stage was set in the mango orchard. The themes were
selected from the stories of the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. Gadādhar
knew by heart almost all the roles, having heard them from professional
actors. His favourite theme was the Vrindāvan episode of Krishna\'s
life, depicting those exquisite love-stories of Krishna and the
milkmaids and the cowherd boys. Gadādhar would play the parts of Rādhā
or Krishna and would often lose himself in the character he was
portraying. His natural feminine grace heightened the dramatic effect.
The mango orchard would ring with the loud kirtan of the boys. Lost in
song and merry-making, Gadādhar became indifferent to the routine of
school.</p>
<p>In 1849 Rāmkumār, the eldest son, went to Calcutta to improve the
financial condition of the family.</p>
<p>Gadādhar was on the threshold of youth. He had become the pet of the
women of the village. They loved to hear him talk, sing, or recite from
the holy books. They enjoyed his knack of imitating voices. Their
woman\'s instinct recognized the innate purity and guilelessness of this
boy of clear skin, flowing hair, beaming eyes, smiling face, and
inexhaustible fun. The pious elderly women looked upon him as Gopālā,
the Baby Krishna,</p>
<p><em>sādhus</em></p>
<p>and the younger ones saw in him the youthful Krishna of Vrindāvan. He
himself so idealised the love of the gopis for Krishna that he sometimes
yearned to be born as a woman, if he must be born again, in order to be
able to love Sri Krishna with all his heart and soul.</p>
<p><strong>Coming to Calcutta</strong></p>
<p>At the age of sixteen Gadādhar was summoned to Calcutta by his elder
brother Rāmkumār, who wished assistance in his priestly duties. Rāmkumār
had opened a Sanskrit academy to supplement his income, and it was his
intention gradually to turn his younger brother\'s mind to education.
Gadādhar applied himself heart and soul to his new duty as family priest
to a number of Calcutta families. His worship was very different from
that of the professional priests. He spent hours decorating the images
and singing hymns and devotional songs; he performed with love the other
duties of his office. People were impressed with his ardour. But to his
studies he paid scant attention.</p>
<p>Rāmkumār did not at first oppose the ways of his temperamental brother.
He wanted Gadādhar to become used to the conditions of city life. But
one day he decided to warn the boy about his indifference to the world.
After all, in the near future Gadādhar must, as a householder, earn his
livelihood through the performance of his brāhminical duties; and these
required a thorough knowledge of Hindu law, astrology, and kindred
subjects. He gently admonished Gadādhar and asked him to pay more
attention to his studies. But the boy replied spiritedly: \"Brother,
what shall I do with a mere bread-winning education? I would rather
acquire that wisdom which will illumine my heart and give me
satisfaction for ever.\"</p>
<p><strong>Bread-winning Education</strong></p>
<p>The anguish of the inner soul of India found expression through these
passionate words of the young Gadādhar. For what did his unsophisticated
eyes see around him in Calcutta, at that time the metropolis of India
and the centre of modern culture and learning? Greed and lust held sway
in the higher levels of society, and the occasional religious practices
were merely outer forms from which the soul had long ago departed.</p>
<p>Gadādhar had never seen anything like this at Kāmārpukur among the
simple and pious villagers. The</p>
<p>and wandering monks whom he had served in his boyhood had revealed to
him an altogether different India. He had been impressed by their
devotion and purity, their self-control and renunciation. He had learnt
from them and from his own intuition that the ideal of life as taught by
the ancient sages of India was the realization of God.</p>
<p>When Rāmkumār reprimanded Gadādhar for neglecting a \"bread-winning
education\", the inner voice of the boy reminded him that the legacy of
his ancestors - the legacy of Rāmā, Krishna, Buddha, Sankara, Rāmānuja,
Chaitanya - was not worldly security but the Knowledge of God. And these
noble sages were the true representatives of Hindu society. Each of them
was seated, as it were, on the crest of the wave that followed each
successive trough in the tumultuous course of Indian national life. All
demonstrated that the life current of India is spirituality. This truth
was revealed to Gadādhar through that inner vision which scans past and
future in one sweep, unobstructed by the barriers of time and space. But
he was unaware of the history of the profound change that had taken
place in the land of his birth during the previous one hundred years.</p>
<p>Hindu society during the eighteenth century had been passing through a
period of decadence. It was the twilight of the Mussalman rule. There
were anarchy and confusion in all spheres. Superstitious practices
dominated the religious life of the people. Rites and rituals passed for
the essence of spirituality. Greedy priests became the custodians of
heaven. True philosophy was supplanted by dogmatic opinions. The pundits
took delight in vain polemics.</p>
<p>In 1757 English traders laid the foundation of British rule in India.
Gradually the Government was systematized and lawlessness suppressed.
The Hindus were much impressed by the military power and political
acumen of the new rulers. In the wake of the merchants came the English
educators, and social reformers, and Christian missionaries - all
bearing a culture completely alien to the Hindu mind. In different parts
of the country educational institutions were set up and Christian
churches established. Hindu young men were offered the heady wine of the
Western culture of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries,
and they drank it to</p>
<p>the very dregs.</p>
<p>The first effect of the draught on the educated Hindus was a complete
effacement from their minds of the time-honoured beliefs and traditions
of Hindu society. They came to believe that there was no transcendental
Truth. The world perceived by the senses was all that existed. God and
religion were illusions of the untutored mind. True knowledge could be
derived only from the analysis of nature. So atheism and agnosticism
became the fashion of the day. The youth of India, taught in English
schools, took malicious delight in openly breaking the customs and
traditions of their society. They would do away with the caste-system
and remove the discriminatory laws about food. Social reform, the spread
of secular education, widow remarriage, abolition of early marriage -
they considered these the panacea for the degenerate condition of Hindu
society.</p>
<p>The Christian missionaries gave the finishing touch to the process of
transformation. They ridiculed as relics of a barbarous age the images
and rituals of the Hindu religion. They tried to persuade India that the
teachings of her saints and seers were the cause of her downfall, that
her Vedas, Purānās, and other scriptures were filled with superstition.
Christianity, they maintained, had given the white races position and
power in this world and assurance of happiness in the next; therefore
Christianity was the best of all religions. Many intelligent young
Hindus became converted. The man in the street was confused. The
majority of the educated grew materialistic in their mental outlook.
Everyone living near Calcutta or the other strongholds of Western
culture, even those who attempted to cling to the orthodox traditions of
Hindu society, became infected by the new uncertainties and the new
beliefs.</p>
<p>But the soul of India was to be resuscitated through a spiritual
awakening. We hear the first call of this renascence in the spirited
retort of the young Gadādhar: \"Brother, what shall I do with a mere
bread-winning education?\"</p>
<p>Rāmkumār could hardly understand the import of his young brother\'s
reply. He described in bright colours the happy and easy life of
scholars in Calcutta society. But Gadādhar intuitively felt that the
scholars, to use one of his own vivid illustrations, were like so many
vultures, soaring high on the wings of their uninspired intellect, with
their eyes fixed on the charnel-pit of greed and lust. So he stood firm
and Rāmkumār had to give way.</p>
<p><strong>Kāli Temple at Dakshineśwar</strong></p>
<p>At that time there lived in Calcutta a rich widow named Rāni Rāsmani,
belonging to the Śudrā caste, and known far and wide not only for her
business ability, courage, and intelligence, but also for her largeness
of heart, piety, and devotion to God. She was assisted in the management
of her vast property by her son-in-law Mathur Mohan.</p>
<p>In 1847 the Rāni purchased twenty acres of land at Dakshineśwar, a
village about four miles north of Calcutta. Here she created a temple
garden and constructed several temples. Her Ishta, or Chosen Ideal, was
the Divine Mother, Kāli.</p>
<p>The temple garden stands directly on the east bank of the Ganges. The
northern section of the land and a portion to the east contain an
orchard, flower gardens, and two small reservoirs. The southern section
is paved with brick and mortar. The visitor arriving by boat ascends the
steps of an imposing bathing-Ghāt, which leads to the <em>Chāndni,</em> a
roofed terrace, on either side of which stand in a row six temples of
Śiva. East of the terrace and the Śiva temples is a large court, paved,
rectangular in shape, and running north and south. Two temples stand in
the centre of this court, the larger one, to the south and facing south,
being dedicated to Kāli, and the smaller one, facing the Ganges, to
Radhākānta, that is, Krishna, the Consort of Rādhā. Nine domes with
spires surmount the temple of Kāli, and before it stands the spacious
Natmandir, or music hall, the terrace of</p>
<p>which is supported by stately pillars. At the northwest and southwest
corners of the temple compound are two <em>Nahabats,</em> or music towers, from
which music flows at different times of day, especially at sunup, noon,
and</p>
<p>sundown, when the worship is performed in the temples. Three sides of
the paved courtyard -all except the west - are lined with rooms set
apart for kitchens, store-rooms, dining-rooms, and quarters for the
temple staff and guests. The chamber in the northwest angle, just beyond
the last of the Śiva temples, is of special</p>
<p>interest to us; for here Sri Ramakrishna was to spend a considerable
part of his life. To the west of this chamber is a semicircular porch
overlooking the river. In front of the porch runs a foot-path, north and
south, and beyond the path is a large garden and, below the garden, the
Ganges. The orchard to the north of the</p>
<p>buildings contains the Panchavati, the banyan, and the bel-tree,
associated with Sri Ramakrishna\'s spiritual practices. Outside and to
the north of the temple compound proper is the <em>Kuthi,</em> or bungalow,
used by</p>
<p>members of Rāni Rāsmani\'s family visiting the garden. And north of the
temple garden, separated from it by a high wall, is a powder-magazine
belonging to the British Government.</p>
<p><strong>Śiva</strong></p>
<p>In the twelve Śiva temples are installed the emblems of the Great God of
renunciation in His various aspects, worshipped daily with proper rites.
Śiva requires few articles of worship. White flowers and bel-leaves and
a little Ganges water offered with devotion are enough to satisfy the
benign Deity and win from Him the boon of liberation.</p>
<p><strong>Radhākānta</strong></p>
<p>The temple of Radhākānta, also known as the temple of Vishnu, contains
the images of Rādhā and Krishna, the symbol of union with God through
ecstatic love. The two images stand on a pedestal facing the west. The
floor is paved with marble. From the ceiling of the porch hang
chandeliers protected from dust by coverings of red cloth. Canvas
screens shield the images from the rays of the setting sun. Close to the
threshold of the inner shrine is a small brass cup containing holy
water. Devoted visitors reverently drink a few drops from the vessel.</p>
<p><strong>Kāli</strong></p>
<p>The main temple is dedicated to Kāli, the Divine Mother, here worshipped
as <em>Bhavatārini,</em> the Saviour of the Universe. The floor of this temple
also is paved with marble. The basalt image of the Mother, dressed in
gorgeous gold brocade, stands on a white marble image of the prostrate
body of Her Divine Consort, Śiva, the symbol of the Absolute. On the
feet of the Goddess are, among other ornaments, anklets of gold. Her
arms are decked with jeweled ornaments of gold. She wears necklaces of
gold and pearls, a golden garland of human heads, and a girdle of human
arms. She wears a golden crown, golden ear-rings, and a golden nose-ring
with a pearl-drop. She has four arms. The lower left hand holds a
severed human head and the upper grips a blood-stained <em>sabre.</em> One
right hand offers boons to Her children; the other allays their fear.
The majesty of Her posture can hardly be described. It combines the
terror of destruction with the reassurance of motherly tenderness. For
She is the Cosmic Power, the totality of the universe, a glorious
harmony of the pairs of opposites. She deals out death, as She creates
and preserves. She has three eyes, the third being the symbol of Divine
Wisdom; they strike dismay into the wicked, yet pour out affection for
Her devotees.</p>
<p>The whole symbolic world is represented in the temple garden - the
Trinity of the Nature Mother (Kāli), the Absolute (Śiva), and Love
(Radhākānta), the Arch spanning heaven and earth. The terrific Goddess
of the Tantra, the soul-enthralling Flute-Player of the Bhāgavata, and
the Self-absorbed Absolute of the Vedas live together, creating the
greatest synthesis of religions. All aspects of Reality are represented
there. But of this divine household, Kāli is the pivot, the sovereign
Mistress. She is <em>Prakriti,</em> the Procreatrix, Nature, the Destroyer, the
Creator. Nay, She is something greater and deeper still for those who
have eyes to see. She is the Universal Mother, \"my Mother\" as
Ramakrishna would say, the All-powerful, who reveals Herself to Her
children under different aspects and Divine Incarnations, the Visible
God, who leads the elect to the Invisible Reality; and if it so pleases
Her, She takes away the last trace of ego from created beings and merges
it in the consciousness of the Absolute, the undifferentiated God.
Through Her grace \"the finite ego loses itself in the illimitable
Ego-Ātman-Brahman\".</p>
<p>Rāni Rāsmani spent a fortune for the construction of the temple garden
and another fortune for its dedication ceremony, which took place on May
31, 1855.</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna - henceforth we shall call Gadādhar by this familiar
name - came to the temple garden with</p>
<p>his elder brother Rāmkumār, who was appointed priest of the Ka1i temple.
Sri Ramakrishna did not at first approve of Rāmkumār\'s working for the
Śudrā Rāsmani. The example of their orthodox father was still fresh in
Sri Ramakrishna\'s mind. He objected also to the eating of the cooked
offerings of the temple, since, according to orthodox Hindu custom, such
food can be offered to the Deity only in the house of a brāhmin. But the
holy atmosphere of the temple grounds, the solitude of the surrounding
wood, the loving care of his brother, the respect shown him by Rāni
Rāsmani and Mathur Bābu, the living presence of the Goddess Kāli in the
temple, and, above all, the proximity of the sacred Ganges, which Sri
Ramakrishna always held in the highest respect, gradually overcame his
disapproval, and he began to feel at home.</p>
<p>Within a very short time Sri Ramakrishna attracted the notice of Mathur
Bābu, who was impressed by the young man\'s religious fervour and wanted
him to participate in the worship in the Kāli temple. But Sri
Ramakrishna loved his freedom and was indifferent to any worldly career.
The profession of the priesthood in a temple founded by a rich woman did
not appeal to his mind. Further, he hesitated to take upon himself the
responsibility for the ornaments and jewellery of the temple. Mathur had
to wait for a suitable occasion.</p>
<p>At this time there came to Dakshineśwar a youth of sixteen, destined to
play an important role in Sri Ramakrishna\'s life. Hriday, a distant
nephew of Sri Ramakrishna, hailed from Sihore, a village not far from
Kāmārpukur, and had been his boyhood friend. Clever, exceptionally
energetic, and endowed with great presence of mind, he moved, as will be
seen later, like a shadow about his uncle and was always ready to help
him, even at the sacrifice of his personal comfort. He was destined to
be a mute witness of many of the spiritual experiences of Sri
Ramakrishna and the caretaker of his body during the stormy days of his
spiritual practice. Hriday came to Dakshineśwar in search of a job, and
Sri Ramakrishna was glad to see him.</p>
<p>Unable to resist the persuasion of Mathur Bābu, Sri Ramakrishna at last
entered the temple service, on condition that Hriday should be asked to
assist him. His first duty was to dress and decorate the image of Kāli.</p>
<p>One day the priest of the Radhākānta temple accidentally dropped the
image of Krishna on the floor, breaking one of its legs. The pundits
advised the Rāni to install a new image, since the worship of an image
with a broken limb was against the scriptural injunctions. But the Rāni
was fond of the image, and she asked Sri Ramakrishna\'s opinion. In an
abstracted mood, he said: \"This solution is ridiculous. If a son-in-law
of the Rāni broke his leg, would she discard him and put another in his
place? Wouldn\'t she rather arrange for his treatment? Why should she
not do the same thing in this case too? Let the image be repaired and
worshipped as before.\" It was a simple, straightforward solution and
was accepted by the Rāni. Sri Ramakrishna himself mended the break. The
priest was dismissed for his carelessness, and at Mathur Bābu\'s earnest
request, Sri Ramakrishna accepted the Office of priest in the Radhākānta
temple.</p>
<p><strong>Sri Ramakrishna as a priest</strong></p>
<p>Born in an orthodox brāhmin family, Sri Ramakrishna knew the formalities
of worship, its rites and rituals. The innumerable gods and goddesses of
the Hindu religion are the human aspects of the indescribable and
incomprehensible Spirit, as conceived by the finite human mind. They
understand and appreciate human love and emotion, help men to realize
their secular and spiritual ideals, and ultimately enable men to attain
liberation from the miseries of phenomenal life. The Source of light,
intelligence, wisdom, and strength is the One alone from whom comes the
fulfilment of desire. Yet, as long as a man is bound by his human
limitations, he cannot but worship God through human forms. He must use
human symbols. Therefore Hinduism asks the devotees to look on God as
the ideal father, the ideal mother, the ideal husband, the ideal son, or
the ideal friend. But the name ultimately leads to the Nameless, the
form to the Formless, the word to the Silence, the emotion to the serene
realization of Peace in Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute. The gods
gradually merge in the one God. But until that realization is achieved,
the devotee cannot dissociate human factors from his worship. Therefore
the Deity is bathed and clothed and decked with ornaments. He is fed and
put to sleep. He is propitiated with hymns, songs, and prayers. And
there are appropriate rites connected with all these functions. For
instance, to secure for himself external purity, the priest bathes
himself in holy water and puts on a holy cloth. He purifies the mind and
the sense organs by appropriate meditations. He fortifies the place of
worship against evil forces by drawing around it circles of fire and
water. He awakens the different spiritual</p>
<p>centres of the body and invokes the Supreme Spirit in his heart. Then he
transfers the Supreme Spirit to the image before him and worships the
image, regarding it no longer as clay or stone, but as the embodiment of
Spirit, throbbing with Life and Consciousness. After the worship the
Supreme Spirit is recalled from the image to Its true sanctuary, the
heart of the priest. The real devotee knows the absurdity of worshipping
the Transcendental Reality with material articles - clothing That which
pervades the whole universe and the beyond, putting on a pedestal That
which cannot be limited by space, feeding That which is disembodied and
incorporeal, singing before That whose glory the music of the spheres
tries vainly to proclaim. But through these rites the devotee aspires to
go ultimately beyond rites and rituals, forms and names, words and
praise, and to realize God as the All-pervading Consciousness.</p>
<p>Hindu priests are thoroughly acquainted with the rites of worship, but
few of them are aware of their underlying significance. They move their
hands and limbs mechanically, in obedience to the letter of the
scriptures, and repeat the holy mantras like parrots. But from the very
beginning the inner meaning of these rites was revealed to Sri
Ramakrishna. As he sat facing the image, a strange transformation came
over his mind. While going through the prescribed ceremonies, he would
actually find himself encircled by a wall of fire protecting him and the
place of worship from unspiritual vibrations, or he would feel the
rising of the mystic Kundalini through the different centres of the
body. The glow on his face, his deep absorption, and the intense
atmosphere of the temple impressed everyone who saw him worship the
Deity.</p>
<p>Rāmkumār wanted Sri Ramakrishna to learn the intricate rituals of the
worship of Kāli. To become a priest of Kāli one must undergo a special
form of initiation from a qualified guru, and for Sri Ramakrishna a
suitable brāhmin was found. But no sooner did the brāhmin speak the holy
word in his ear than Sri Ramakrishna, overwhelmed with emotion, uttered
a loud cry and plunged into deep concentration.</p>
<p>Mathur begged Sri Ramakrishna to take charge of the worship in the Kāli
temple. The young priest pleaded his incompetence and his ignorance of
the scriptures. Mathur insisted that devotion and sincerity would more
than compensate for any lack of formal knowledge and make the Divine
Mother manifest Herself through the image. In the end, Sri Ramakrishna
had to yield to Mathur\'s request. He became the priest of Kāli.</p>
<p>In 1856 Rāmkumār breathed his last. Sri Ramakrishna had already
witnessed more than one death in the family. He had come to realize how
impermanent is life on earth. The more he was convinced of the
transitory nature of worldly things, the more eager he became to realize
God, the Fountain of Immortality.</p>

<p>and Her waist with a girdle of human arms and two of Her hands hold
weapons of death, and Her eyes dart a glance of fire; but, strangely
enough, Ramakrishna felt in Her breath the soothing touch of tender love
and saw in Her the Seed of Immortality. She stands on the bosom of Her
Consort, Śiva; it is because She is the</p>
<p>Śakti, the Power, inseparable from the Absolute. She is surrounded by
jackals and other unholy creatures, the denizens of the cremation
ground. But is not the Ultimate Reality above holiness and unholiness?
She appears to be reeling under the spell of wine. But who would create
this mad world unless under the influence of a divine drunkenness? She
is the highest symbol of all the forces of nature, the synthesis of
their antinomies, the Ultimate Divine in the form of woman. She now
became to Sri Ramakrishna the only Reality, and the world became an
unsubstantial shadow. Into Her worship he poured his soul. Before him
She stood as the transparent portal to the shrine of Ineffable Reality.</p>
<p>The worship in the temple intensified Sri Ramakrishna\'s yearning for a
living vision of the Mother of the Universe. He began to spend in
meditation the time not actually employed in the temple service; and for
this purpose he selected an extremely solitary place. A deep jungle,
thick with underbrush and prickly plants, lay to the north of the
temples. Used at one time as a burial ground, it was shunned by people
even during the day-time for fear of ghosts. There Sri Ramakrishna began
to spend the whole night in meditation, returning to his</p>
<p>room only in the morning with eyes swollen as though from much weeping.
While meditating, he would lay aside his cloth and his brāhminical
thread. Explaining this strange conduct, he once said to Hriday:
\"Don\'t you know that when one thinks of God one should be freed from
all ties? From our very birth we have the eight fetters of hatred,
shame, lineage, pride of good conduct, fear, secretiveness, caste, and
grief. The sacred thread reminds me that I am a brāhmin and therefore
superior to all. When calling on the Mother one has to set aside all
such ideas.\" Hriday thought his uncle was becoming insane.</p>
<p>As his love for God deepened, he began either to forget or to drop the
formalities of worship. Sitting before the image, he would spend hours
singing the devotional songs of great devotees of the Mother, such as
Kamalākānta and Rāmprasād. Those rhapsodical songs, describing the
direct vision of God, only intensified Sri Ramakrishna\'s longing. He
felt the pangs of a child separated from its mother. Sometimes, in
agony, he would rub his face against the ground and weep so bitterly
that people, thinking he had lost his earthly mother, would sympathize
with him in his grief. Sometimes, in moments of scepticism, he would
cry: \"Art Thou true, Mother, or is it all fiction - mere poetry without
any reality? If Thou dost exist, why do I not see Thee? Is religion a
mere fantasy and art Thou only a figment of man\'s imagination?\"
Sometimes he would sit on the prayer carpet for two hours like an inert
object. He began to behave in an abnormal manner, most of the time
unconscious of the world. He almost gave up food; and sleep left him
altogether.</p>
<p>But he did not have to wait very long. He has thus described his first
vision of the Mother: \"I felt as if my heart were being squeezed like a
wet towel. I was overpowered with a great restlessness and a fear that
it might not be my lot to realize Her in this life. I could not bear the
separation from Her any longer. Life seemed to be not worth living.
Suddenly my glance fell on the sword that was kept in the Mother\'s
temple. I determined to put an end to my life. When I jumped up like a
madman and seized it, suddenly the blessed Mother revealed Herself. The
buildings with their different parts, the temple, and everything else
vanished from my sight, leaving no trace whatsoever, and in their stead
I saw a limitless, infinite, effulgent Ocean of Consciousness. As far as
the eye could see, the shining billows were madly rushing at me from all
sides with a terrific noise, to swallow me up! I was panting for breath.
I was caught in the rush and collapsed, unconscious. What was happening
in the outside world I did not know; but within me there was a steady
flow of undiluted bliss, altogether new, and I felt the presence of the
Divine Mother.\" On his lips when he regained consciousness of the world
was the word \"Mother\".</p>
<p><strong>God-Intoxicated State</strong></p>
<p>Yet this was only a foretaste of the intense experiences to come. The
first glimpse of the Divine Mother made him the more eager for Her
uninterrupted vision. He wanted to see Her both in meditation and with
eyes open. But the Mother began to play a teasing game of hide-and-seek
with him, intensifying both his joy and his suffering. Weeping bitterly
during the moments of separation from Her, he would pass into a trance
and then find Her standing before him, smiling, talking, consoling,
bidding him be of good cheer, and instructing him. During this period of
spiritual practice he had many uncommon experiences. When he sat to
meditate, he would hear strange clicking sounds in the joints of his
legs, as if someone were locking them up, one after the other, to keep
him motionless; and at the conclusion of his meditation he would again
hear the same sounds, this time unlocking them and leaving him free to
move about. He would see flashes like a swarm of fire-flies floating
before his eyes, or a sea of deep mist around him, with luminous waves
of molten silver. Again, from a sea of translucent mist he would behold
the Mother rising, first Her feet, then Her waist, body, face, and head,
finally Her whole person; he would feel Her breath and hear Her voice.
Worshipping in the temple, sometimes he would become exalted, sometimes
he would remain motionless as stone, sometimes he would almost collapse
from excessive emotion. Many of his actions, contrary to all tradition,
seemed sacrilegious to the people. He would take a flower and touch it
to his own head, body, and feet, and then offer it to the Goddess. Or,
like a drunkard, he would reel to the throne of the Mother, touch Her
chin by way of showing his affection for Her, and sing, talk, joke,
laugh, and dance. Or he would take a morsel of food from the plate and
hold it to Her mouth, begging Her to eat it, and would not be satisfied
till he was convinced that She had really eaten. After the Mother had
been put to sleep at night, from his own room he would hear Her
ascending to the upper storey of the temple with the light steps of a
happy girl, Her anklets jingling. Then he would discover Her</p>
<p>standing with flowing hair, Her black form silhouetted against the sky
of the night looking at the Ganges or at the distant lights of Calcutta.</p>
<p>Naturally the temple officials took him for an insane person. His
worldly well-wishers brought him to skilled physicians; but no medicine
could cure his malady. Many a time he doubted his sanity himself. For he
had been sailing across an uncharted sea, with no earthly guide to
direct him. His only haven of security was the Divine Mother Herself. To
Her he would pray: \"I do not know what these things are. I am ignorant
of mantras and the scriptures. Teach me, Mother, how to realize Thee.
Who else can help me? Art Thou not my only refuge and guide?\" And the
sustaining presence of the Mother never failed him in his distress or
doubt. Even those who criticized his conduct were greatly impressed with
his purity, guilelessness, truthfulness, integrity, and holiness. They
felt an uplifting influence in his presence.</p>
<p>It is said that Samādhi, or trance, no more than opens the portal of the
spiritual realm. Sri Ramakrishna felt an unquenchable desire to enjoy
God in various ways. For his meditation he built a place in the northern
wooded section of the temple garden. With Hriday\'s help he planted
there five sacred trees. The spot, known as the Panchavati, became the
scene of many of his visions.</p>
<p>As his spiritual mood deepened he more and more felt himself to be a
child of the Divine Mother. He learnt to surrender himself completely to
Her will and let Her direct him.</p>
<p>\"O Mother,\" he would constantly pray, \"I have taken refuge in Thee.
Teach me what to do and what to say. Thy will is paramount everywhere
and is for the good of Thy children. Merge my will in Thy will and make
me Thy instrument.\"</p>
<p>His visions became deeper and more intimate. He no longer had to
meditate to behold the Divine Mother. Even while retaining consciousness
of the outer world, he would see Her as tangibly as the temples, the
trees, the river, and the men around him.</p>
<p>On a certain occasion Mathur Bābu stealthily entered the temple to watch
the worship. He was profoundly moved by the young priest\'s devotion and
sincerity. He realized that Sri Ramakrishna had transformed the stone
image into the living Goddess.</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna one day fed a cat with the food that was to be offered
to Kāli. This was too much for the manager of the temple garden, who
considered himself responsible for the proper conduct of the worship. He
reported Sri Ramakrishna\'s insane behaviour to Mathur Bābu.</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna has described the incident: \"The Divine Mother revealed
to me in the Kāli temple that it was She who had become everything. She
showed me that everything was full of Consciousness. The image was
Consciousness, the altar was Consciousness, the water-vessels were
Consciousness, the door-sill was Consciousness, the marble floor was
Consciousness - all was Consciousness. I found everything inside the
room soaked, as it were, in Bliss - the Bliss of God. I saw a wicked man
in front of the Kāli temple; but in him also I saw the power of the
Divine Mother vibrating. That was why I fed a cat with the food that was
to be offered to the Divine Mother. I clearly perceived that all this
was the Divine Mother - even the cat. The manager of the temple garden
wrote to Mathur Bābu saying that I was feeding the cat with the offering
intended for the Divine Mother. But Mathur Bābu had insight into the
state of my mind. He wrote back to the manager: \'Let him do whatever he
likes. You must not say anything to him.\' \"</p>
<p>One of the painful ailments from which Sri Ramakrishna suffered at this
time was a burning sensation in his body, and he was cured by a strange
vision. During worship in the temple, following the scriptural
injunctions, he would imagine the presence of the \"sinner\" in himself
and the destruction of this \"sinner\". One day he was meditating in the
Panchavati, when he saw come out of him a red-eyed man of black
complexion, reeling like a drunkard. Soon there emerged from him another
person, of serene countenance, wearing the ochre cloth of a sannyāsi and
carrying in his hand a trident. The second person attacked the first and
killed him with the trident. Thereafter Sri Ramakrishna was free of his
pain.</p>
<p><em>Bhāva-mukha,</em></p>
<p>About this time he began to worship God by assuming the attitude of a
servant toward his master. He imitated the mood of Hanuman, the monkey
chieftain of the Ramayana, the ideal servant of Rāmā and traditional
model for this self-effacing form of devotion. When he meditated on
Hanuman his movements and his way of life began to resemble those of a
monkey. His eyes became restless. He lived on fruits and roots. With his
cloth tied around his waist, a portion of it hanging in the form of a
tail, he jumped from place to place instead of walking. And after a
short while he was blessed with a vision of Sitā, the divine consort of
Rāmā, who entered his body and disappeared there with the words, \"I
bequeath to you my smile.\"</p>
<p>Mathur had faith in the sincerity of Sri Ramakrishna\'s spiritual zeal,
but began now to doubt his sanity. He had watched him jumping about like
a monkey. One day, when Rāni Rāsmani was listening to Sri Ramakrishna\'s
singing in the temple, the young priest abruptly turned and slapped her.
Apparently listening to his song, she had actually been thinking of a
lawsuit. She accepted the punishment as though the Divine Mother Herself
had imposed it; but Mathur was distressed. He begged Sri Ramakrishna to
keep his feelings under control and to heed the conventions of society.
God Himself, he argued, follows laws. God never permitted, for instance,
flowers of two colours to grow on the same stalk. The following day Sri
Ramakrishna presented Mathur Bābu with two hibiscus flowers growing on
the same stalk, one red and one white.</p>
<p>Mathur and Rāni Rāsmani began to ascribe the mental ailment of Sri
Ramakrishna in part, at least, to his observance of rigid continence.
Thinking that a natural life would relax the tension of his nerves, they
engineered a plan with two women of ill fame. But as soon as the women
entered his room, Sri Ramakrishna beheld in them the manifestation of
the Divine Mother of the Universe and went into Samādhi uttering Her
name.</p>
<p><strong>Haladhāri</strong></p>
<p>In 1858 there came to Dakshineśwar a cousin of Sri Ramakrishna,
Haladhāri by name, who was to remain there about eight years. On account
of Sri Ramakrishna\'s indifferent health, Mathur appointed this man to
the office of priest in the Kāli temple. He was a complex character,
versed in the letter of the scriptures, but hardly aware of their
spirit. He loved to participate in hair-splitting theological
discussions and, by the measure of his own erudition, he proceeded to
gauge Sri Ramakrishna. An orthodox brāhmin, he thoroughly disapproved of
his cousin\'s unorthodox actions, but he was not unimpressed by Sri
Ramakrishna\'s purity of life, ecstatic love of God, and yearning for
realization.</p>
<p>One day Haladhāri upset Sri Ramakrishna with the statement that God is
incomprehensible to the human mind. Sri Ramakrishna has described the
great moment of doubt when he wondered whether his visions had really
misled him: \"With sobs I prayed to the Mother, \'Canst Thou have the
heart to deceive me like this because I am a fool?\' A stream of tears
flowed from my eyes. Shortly afterwards I saw a volume of mist rising
from the floor and filling the space before me. In the midst of it there
appeared a face with flowing beard,</p>
<p>calm, highly expressive, and fair. Fixing its gaze steadily upon me, it
said solemnly, \'Remain in</p>
<p>on the threshold of relative consciousness.\' This it repeated three
times and then it gently disappeared in the mist, which itself
dissolved. This vision reassured me.\"</p>
<p>A garbled report of Sri Ramakrishna\'s failing health, indifference to
worldly life, and various abnormal activities reached Kāmārpukur and
filled the heart of his poor mother with anguish. At her repeated
request he returned to his village for a change of air. But his boyhood
friends did not interest him any more. A divine fever was consuming him.
He spent a great part of the day and night in one of the cremation
grounds, in meditation. The place reminded him of the impermanence of
the human body, of human hopes and achievements. It also reminded him of
Kāli, the Goddess of destruction.</p>
<p><strong>Marriage and After</strong></p>
<p>But in a few months his health showed improvement, and he recovered to
some extent his natural buoyancy of spirit. His happy mother was
encouraged to think it might be a good time to arrange his marriage. The
boy was now twenty-three years old. A wife would bring him back to
earth. And she was delighted when her son</p>
<p>welcomed her suggestion. Perhaps he saw in it the finger of God.</p>
<p>Saradāmani, a little girl of five, lived in the neighbouring village
called Jayrāmbāti. Even at this age she had been praying to God to make
her character as stainless and fragrant as the white tuberose. Looking
at the full moon, she would say: \"O God, there are dark spots even on
the moon. But make my character spotless.\" It was she who was selected
as the bride for Sri Ramakrishna.</p>
<p>The marriage ceremony was duly performed. Such early marriage in India
is in the nature of a betrothal, the marriage being consummated when the
girl attains puberty. But in this case the marriage remained for ever
unconsummated. Sri Ramakrishna lived at Kāmārpukur about a year and a
half and then returned to Dakshineśwar.</p>
<p>Hardly had he crossed the threshold of the Kāli temple when he found
himself again in the whirlwind. His madness reappeared tenfold. The same
meditation and prayer, the same ecstatic moods, the same burning
sensation, the same weeping, the same sleeplessness, the same
indifference to the body and the outside world, the same divine
delirium. He subjected himself to fresh disciplines in order to
eradicate greed and lust, the two great impediments to spiritual
progress. With a rupee in one hand and some earth in the other, he would
reflect on the comparative value of these two for the realization of
God, and finding them equally worthless he would toss them, with equal
indifference, into the Ganges. Women he regarded as the manifestations
of the Divine Mother. Never even in a dream did he feel the impulses of
lust. And to root out of his mind the idea of caste superiority, he
cleaned a pariah\'s house with his long and neglected hair. When he
would sit in meditation, birds would perch on his head and peck in his
hair for grains of food. Snakes would crawl over his body, and neither
would he aware of the other. Sleep left him altogether. Day and night,
visions flitted before him. He saw the sannyāsi who had previously
killed the \"sinner\" in him again coming out of his body, threatening
him with the trident, and ordering him to concentrate on God. Or the
same sannyāsi would visit distant places, following a luminous path, and
bring him reports of what was happening there. Sri Ramakrishna used to
say later that in the case of an advanced devotee the mind itself
becomes the guru, living and moving like an embodied being.</p>
<p>Rāni Rāsmani, the foundress of the temple garden, passed away in 1861.
After her death her son-in-law Mathur became the sole executor of the
estate. He placed himself and his resources at the disposal of Sri
Ramakrishna and began to look after his physical comfort. Sri
Ramakrishna later spoke of him as one of his five \"suppliers of
stores\" appointed by the Divine Mother. Whenever a desire arose in his
mind, Mathur fulfilled it without hesitation.</p>
<p><strong>The Brāhmani</strong></p>
<p>There came to Dakshineśwar at this time a brāhmin woman who was to play
an important part in Sri Ramakrishna\'s spiritual unfoldment. Born in
East Bengāl, she was an adept in the Tāntrik and Vaishnava methods of
worship. She was slightly over fifty years of age, handsome, and garbed
in the orange robe of a nun. Her sole possessions were a few books and
two pieces of wearing-cloth.</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna welcomed the visitor with great respect, described to
her his experiences and visions, and told her of people\'s belief that
these were symptoms of madness. She listened to him attentively and
said: \"My son, everyone in this world is mad. Some are mad for money,
some for creature comforts, some for name and fame; and you are mad for
God.\" She assured him that he was passing through the almost unknown
spiritual experience described in the scriptures as <em>Mahā--bhāva,</em> the
most exalted rapture of divine love. She told him that this extreme
exaltation had been described as manifesting itself through nineteen
physical symptoms, including the shedding of tears, a tremor of the
body, horripilation, perspiration, and a burning sensation. The Bhakti
scriptures, she declared, had recorded only two instances of the
experience, namely, those of Sri Rādhā and Sri Chaitanya.</p>
<p>Very soon a tender relationship sprang up between Sri Ramakrishna and
the Brāhmani, she looking upon him as the Baby Krishna, and he upon her
as mother. Day after day, she watched his ecstasy during the kirtan and</p>
<p><em>Mahā-bhāva</em></p>
<p>meditation, his Samādhi, his mad yearning; and she recognized in him a
power to transmit spirituality to others. She came to the conclusion
that such things were not possible for an ordinary devotee, not even for
a highly developed soul. Only an Incarnation of God was capable of such
spiritual manifestations. She proclaimed openly that Sri Ramakrishna,
like Sri Chaitanya, was an Incarnation of God.</p>
<p>When Sri Ramakrishna told Mathur what the Brāhmani had said about him,
Mathur shook his head in doubt. He was reluctant to accept him as an
Incarnation of God, an Avatar comparable to Rāmā, Krishna, Buddha, and
Chaitanya, though he admitted Sri Ramakrishna\'s extraordinary
spirituality. Whereupon the Brāhmani asked Mathur to arrange a
conference of scholars who should discuss the matter with her. He agreed
to the proposal and the meeting was arranged. It was to be held in the
Natmandir in front of the Kāli temple.</p>
<p>Two famous pundits of the time were invited: Vaishnavcharan, the leader
of the Vaishnava society, and Gauri. The first to arrive was
Vaishnavcharan, with a distinguished company of scholars and devotees.
The Brāhmani, like a proud mother, proclaimed her view before him and
supported it with quotations from the scriptures. As the pundits
discussed the deep theological question, Sri Ramakrishna, perfectly
indifferent to everything happening around him, sat in their midst like
a child, immersed in his own thoughts, sometimes smiling, sometimes
chewing a pinch of spices from a pouch, or again saying to
Vaishnavcharan with a nudge: \"Look here. Sometimes I feel like this,
too.\" Presently Vaishnavcharan arose to declare himself in total
agreement</p>
<p>with the view of the Brāhmani. He declared that Sri Ramakrishna had
undoubtedly experienced</p>
<p>and that this was the certain sign of the rare manifestation of God in a
man. The people assembled there, especially the officers of the temple
garden, were struck dumb. Sri Ramakrishna said to Mathur, like a boy:
\"Just fancy, he too says so! Well, I am glad to learn that, after all,
it is not a disease.\"</p>
<p>When, a few days later, Pundit Gauri arrived, another meeting was held,
and he agreed with the view of the Brāhmani and Vaishnavcharan. To Sri
Ramakrishna\'s remark that Vaishnavcharan had declared him to be an
<em>Avatār,</em> Gauri replied: \"Is that all he has to say about you? Then he
has said very little. I am fully convinced that you are that Mine of
Spiritual Power, only a small fraction of which descends on earth, from
time to time, in the form of an Incarnation.\"</p>
<p>\"Ah!\" said Sri Ramakrishna with a smile, \"You seem to have quite
outbid Vaishnavcharan in this matter. What have you found in me that
makes you entertain such an idea?\"</p>
<p>Gauri said: \"I feel it in my heart and I have the scriptures on my
side. I am ready to prove it to anyone who challenges me.\"</p>
<p>\"Well,\" Sri Ramakrishna said, \"it is you who say so; but, believe me,
I know nothing about it.\"</p>
<p>Thus, the insane priest was, by verdict of the great scholars of the
day, proclaimed a Divine Incarnation. His visions were not the result of
an over heated brain; they had precedent in spiritual history. And how
did the proclamation affect Sri Ramakrishna himself? He remained the
simple child of the Mother that he had been since the first day of his
life. Years later, when two of his householder disciples openly spoke of
him as a Divine Incarnation and the matter was reported to him, he said
with a touch of sarcasm: \"Do they think they will enhance my glory that
way? One of them is an actor on the stage and the other a physician.
What do they know about Incarnations? Why years ago pundits like Gauri
and Vaishnavcharan declared me to be an Avatar. They were great scholars
and knew what they said. But that did not make any change in my mind.\"</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna was a learner all his life. He often used to quote a
proverb to his disciples: \"Friend, the more I live the more I learn.\"
When the excitement created by the Brāhmani\'s declaration was over, he
set himself to the task of practising spiritual disciplines according to
the traditional methods laid down in the Tantra and Vaishnava
scriptures. Hitherto he had pursued his spiritual ideal according to the
promptings of his own mind and heart. Now he accepted the Brāhmani as
his guru and set foot on the traditional highways.</p>
<p><strong>Tantra</strong></p>
<p>According to the Tantra, the Ultimate Reality is <em>Chit,</em> or
Consciousness, which is identical with <em>Sat,</em> or Being, and with
<em>Ānanda,</em> or Bliss. This Ultimate Reality, <em>Satchidānanda,</em>
Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute, is</p>
<p>identical with the Reality preached in the Vedas. And man is identical
with this Reality; but under the influence of <em>Māyā,</em> or illusion, he
has forgotten his true nature. He takes to be real a merely apparent
world of subject and object, and this error is the cause of his bondage
and suffering. The goal of spiritual discipline is the rediscovery of
his true identity with the divine Reality.</p>
<p>For the achievement of this goal the Vedānta prescribes an austere
negative method of discrimination and renunciation, which can be
followed by only a few individuals endowed with sharp intelligence and
unshakeable will-power. But Tantra takes into consideration the natural
weakness of human beings, their lower appetites, and their love for the
concrete. It combines philosophy with rituals, meditation with
ceremonies, renunciation with enjoyment. The underlying purpose is
gradually to train the aspirant to meditate on his identity with the
Ultimate.</p>
<p>The average man wishes to enjoy the material objects of the world.
Tantra bids him enjoy these, but at the same time, discover in them the
presence of God. Mystical rites are prescribed by which, slowly, the
sense objects become spiritualized and sense attraction is transformed
into a love of God. So the very \"bonds\" of man are turned into
\"releasers\". The very poison that kills is transmuted into the elixir
of life. Outward renunciation is not necessary. Thus, the aim of Tantra
is to sublimate <em>Bhoga,</em> or enjoyment, into <em>Yoga,</em> or union with
Consciousness. For, according to this philosophy, the world with all its
manifestations is nothing but the sport of Śiva and Śakti, the Absolute
and Its inscrutable Power.</p>
<p>The disciplines of Tantra are graded to suit aspirants of all degrees.
Exercises are prescribed for people with \"animal\", \"heroic\", and
\"divine\" outlooks. Certain of the rites require the presence of
members of the opposite sex. Here the aspirant learns to look on woman
as the embodiment of the Goddess Kāli, the Mother of the Universe. The
very basis of Tantra is the Motherhood of God and the glorification of
woman. Every part of a woman\'s body is to be regarded as incarnate
Divinity. But the rites are extremely dangerous. The help of a qualified
guru is absolutely necessary. An unwary devotee may lose his foothold
and fall into a pit of depravity.</p>
<p>According to the Tantra, Śakti is the active creative force in the
universe. Śiva, the Absolute, is a more or less passive principle.
Further, Śakti is as inseparable from Śiva as fire\'s power to burn is
from fire itself. Śakti, the Creative Power, contains in Its womb the
universe, and therefore is the Divine Mother. All women are Her symbols.
Kāli is one of Her several forms. The meditation on Kāli, the Creative
Power, is the central discipline of the Tantra. While meditating, the
aspirant at first regards himself as one with the Absolute and then
thinks that out of that Impersonal Consciousness emerge two entities,
namely, his own self and the living form of the Goddess. He then
projects the Goddess into the tangible image before him and worships it
as the Divine Mother.</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna set himself to the task of practising the disciplines of
Tantra; and at the bidding of the Divine Mother Herself he accepted the
Brāhmani as his guru. He performed profound and delicate ceremonies in
the Panchavati and under the bel-tree at the northern extremity of the
temple compound. He practised all the disciplines of the sixty-four
principal Tantra books, and it took him never more than three days to
achieve the result promised in any one of them. After the observance of
a few preliminary rites, he would be overwhelmed with a strange divine
fervour and would go into Samādhi, where his mind would dwell in
exaltation. Evil ceased to exist for him. The word \"carnal\" lost its
meaning. The whole world and everything in it appeared as the Lila, the
sport, of Śiva and Śakti. He beheld everywhere manifest the power and
beauty of the Mother, the whole world, animate and inanimate, appeared
to him as pervaded with Chit, Consciousness, and with Ānanda, Bliss.</p>
<p>He saw in a vision the Ultimate Cause of the universe as a huge luminous
triangle giving birth every moment to an infinite number of worlds. He
heard the <em>Anāhata Śabda,</em> the great sound <strong>Om,</strong> of which the
innumerable sounds of the universe are only so many echoes. He acquired
the eight supernatural powers of Yoga, which make a man almost
omnipotent, and these he spurned as of no value whatsoever to the
Spirit. He had a vision of the divine Māyā, the inscrutable Power of
God, by which the universe is created and sustained, and into</p>
<p>which it is finally absorbed. In this vision he saw a woman of exquisite
beauty, about to become a mother, emerging from the Ganges and slowly
approaching the Panchavati. Presently she gave birth to a child and
began to nurse it tenderly. A moment later she assumed a terrible
aspect, seized the child with her grim jaws and crushed it. Swallowing
it, she re-entered the waters of the Ganges.</p>
<p>But the most remarkable experience during this period was the awakening
of the <em>Kundalini Śakti,</em> the \"Serpent</p>
<p>Power\". He actually saw the Power, at first lying asleep at the bottom
of the spinal column, then waking up and ascending along the mystic
<em>Sushumna</em> canal and through its six centres, or lotuses, to the
<em>Sahasrāra,</em> the</p>
<p>thousand-petalled lotus in the top of the head. He further saw that as
the Kundalini went upward the different lotuses bloomed. And this
phenomenon was accompanied by visions and trances. Later on he described
to his disciples and devotees the various movements of the Kundalini:
the fishlike, birdlike, monkey like, and so on.</p>
<p>The awakening of the Kundalini is the beginning of spiritual
consciousness, and its union with Śiva in the <em>Sahasrāra,</em> ending in
Samādhi, is the consummation of the Tāntrik disciplines.</p>
<p>About this time it was revealed to him that in a short while many
devotees would seek his guidance.</p>
<p><strong>Vaishnava Disciplines</strong></p>
<p>After completing the Tāntrik sādhana Sri Ramakrishna followed the
Brāhmani in the disciplines of Vaishnavism. The Vaishnavas are
worshippers of Vishnu, the \"All-pervading\", the Supreme God, who is
also known as Hari and Nārāyana. Of Vishnu\'s various Incarnations the
two with the largest number of followers are Rāmā and Krishna.</p>
<p>Vaishnavism is exclusively a religion of bhakti. Bhakti is intense love
of God, attachment to Him alone; it is of the nature of bliss and
bestows upon the lover immortality and liberation. God, according to
Vaishnavism, cannot be realized through logic or reason; and, without
bhakti, all penances, austerities, and rites are futile. Man cannot
realize God by self-exertion alone. For the vision of God His grace is
absolutely necessary, and this grace is felt by the pure of heart. The
mind is to be purified through bhakti. The pure mind then remains for
ever immersed in the ecstasy of God-vision. It is the cultivation of
this divine love that is the chief concern of the Vaishnava religion.</p>
<p>There are three kinds of formal devotion: tāmasic, rājasic, and sāttvic.
If a person, while showing devotion to God, is actuated by malevolence,
arrogance, jealousy, or anger, then his devotion is tāmasic, since it is
influenced by tamas, the quality of inertia. If he worships God from a
desire for fame or wealth, or from any other worldly ambition, then his
devotion is rājasic, since it is influenced by rajas, the quality of
activity. But if a person loves God without any thought of material
gain, if he performs his duties to please God alone and maintains toward
all created beings the attitude of friendship, then his devotion is
called sāttvic, since it is influenced by sattva, the quality of
harmony. But the highest devotion transcends the three <em>gunās,</em> or
qualities, being a spontaneous, uninterrupted inclination of the mind
toward God, the Inner Soul of all beings; and it wells up in the heart
of a true devotee as soon as he hears the name of God or mention of
God\'s attributes. A devotee possessed of this love would not accept the
happiness of heaven if it were offered him. His one desire is to love
God under all conditions - in pleasure and pain, life and death, honour
and dishonour, prosperity and adversity.</p>
<p>There are two stages of bhakti. The first is known as <em>Vaidhi--Bhakti,</em>
or love of God qualified by scriptural injunctions. For the devotees of
this stage are prescribed regular and methodical worship, hymns,
prayers, the</p>
<p>repetition of God\'s name, and the chanting of His glories. This lower
bhakti in course of time matures into <em>Parā--Bhakti,</em> or supreme
devotion, known also as <em>Prema,</em> the most intense form of divine love.
Divine love is</p>
<p>an end in itself. It exists potentially in all human hearts, but in the
case of bound creatures it is misdirected to earthly objects.</p>
<p>To develop the devotee\'s love for God, Vaishnavism humanises God. God
is to be regarded as the devotee\'s Parent, Master, Friend, Child,
Husband, or Sweetheart, each succeeding relationship representing an
intensification of love. These <em>Bhāvās,</em> or attitudes toward God, are
known as Śānta, Dāsya, Sakhya, Vātsalya,</p>
<p>and Madhur. The rishis of the Vedās, Hanumān, the cowherd boys of
Vrindāvan, Rāmā\'s mother Kausalya, and Rādhika, Krishna\'s sweetheart,
exhibited, respectively, the most perfect examples of these forms. In
the ascending scale the glories of God are gradually forgotten and the
devotee realizes more and more the intimacy of divine communion. Finally
he regards himself as the mistress of his Beloved, and no artificial
barrier remains to separate him from his Ideal. No social or moral
obligation can bind to the earth his soaring spirit. He experiences
perfect union with the Godhead. Unlike the Vedantist, who strives to
transcend all varieties of the subject-object relationship, a devotee of
the Vaishnava path wishes to retain both his own individuality and the
personality of God. To him God is not an intangible Absolute, but the
<em>Purushottama,</em> the Supreme Person.</p>
<p>While practising the discipline of the Madhur Bhāva, the male devotee
often regards himself as a woman, in order to develop the most intense
form of love for Sri Krishna, the only <em>Purusha,</em> or man, in the
universe. This</p>
<p>assumption of the attitude of the opposite sex has a deep psychological
significance. It is a matter of common experience that an idea may be
cultivated to such an intense degree that every idea alien to it is
driven from the mind. This peculiarity of the mind may he utilised for
the subjugation of the lower desires and the development of the
spiritual nature. Now, the idea which is the basis of all desires and
passions in a man is the conviction of his indissoluble association with
a male body. If he can inoculate himself thoroughly with the idea that
he is a woman, he can get rid of the desires peculiar to his male body.
Again, the idea that he is a woman may in turn be made to give way to
another higher idea, namely, that he is neither man nor woman, but the
Impersonal Spirit. The Impersonal Spirit alone can enjoy real communion
with the Impersonal God. Hence the highest realization of the Vaishnava
draws close to the transcendental experience of the Vedantist.</p>
<p>A beautiful expression of the Vaishnava worship of God through love is
to be found in the Vrindāvan episode of the Bhāgavata. The gopis, or
milk-maids, of Vrindāvan regarded the six-year-old Krishna as their
Beloved. They sought no personal gain or happiness from this love. They
surrendered to Krishna their bodies, minds, and souls. Of all the gopis,
Rādhika, or Rādhā, because of her intense love for Him, was the closest
to Krishna. She manifested Mahā--bhāva and was united with her Beloved.
This union represents, through sensuous language, a supersensuous
experience.</p>
<p>Sri Chaitanya, also known as Gaurānga, Gorā, or Nimāi, born in Bengāl in
1485 and regarded as an Incarnation of God, is a great prophet of the
Vaishnava religion. Chaitanya declared the chanting of God\'s name to be
the most efficacious spiritual discipline for the Kali--Yuga.</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna, as the monkey Hanumān, had already worshipped God as
his Master. Through his devotion to Kāli he had worshipped God as his
Mother. He was now to take up the other relationships prescribed by the
Vaishnava scriptures.</p>
<p><strong>Ramlālā</strong></p>
<p>About the year 1864 there came to Dakshineśwar a wandering Vaishnava
monk, Jatādhāri, whose Ideal Deity was Rāmā. He always carried with him
a small metal image of the Deity, which he called by the endearing name
of Ramlālā, the Boy Rāmā. Toward this little image he displayed the
tender affection of Kausalya for her divine Son, Rāmā. As a result of
lifelong spiritual practice he had actually found in the metal image the
presence of his Ideal. Ramlālā was no longer for him a metal image, but
the living God. He devoted himself to nursing Rāmā, feeding Rāmā,
playing with Rāmā, taking Rāmā for a walk, and bathing Rāmā. And he
found that the image responded to his love.</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna, much impressed with his devotion, requested Jatādhāri
to spend a few days at Dakshineśwar. Soon Ramlālā became the favourite
companion of Sri Ramakrishna too. Later on he described to the devotees
how the little image would dance gracefully before him, jump on his
back, insist on being taken in his arms, run to the fields in the sun,
pluck flowers from the bushes, and play pranks like a naughty boy. A
very sweet relationship sprang up between him and Ramlālā, for whom he
felt the love of a mother.</p>
<p>One day Jatādhāri requested Sri Ramakrishna to keep the image and bade
him adieu with tearful eyes. He declared that Ramlālā had fulfilled his
innermost prayer and that he now had no more need of formal worship.</p>
<p>A few days later Sri Ramakrishna was blessed through Ramlālā with a
vision of Rāmachandra, whereby he realized that the Rāmā of the
Ramayana, the son of Daśaratha, pervades the whole universe as Spirit
and Consciousness; that He is its Creator, Sustainer, and Destroyer;
that, in still another aspect, He is the transcendental Brahman, without
form, attribute, or name.</p>
<p>While worshipping Ramlālā as the Divine Child, Sri Ramakrishna\'s heart
became filled with motherly tenderness, and he began to regard himself
as a woman. His speech and gestures changed. He began to move freely
with the ladies of Mathur\'s family, who now looked upon him as one of
their own sex. During this time he worshipped the Divine Mother as Her
companion or handmaid.</p>
<p><strong>In Communion with the Divine Beloved</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sri Ramakrishna now devoted himself to scaling the most inaccessible
and dizzy heights of dualistic worship, namely, the complete union with
Sri Krishna as the Beloved of the heart. He regarded himself as one of
the gopis of Vrindāvan, mad with longing for her divine Sweetheart. At
his request Mathur provided him with woman\'s dress and jewellery. In
this love pursuit, food and drink were forgotten. Day and night he wept
bitterly. The yearning turned into a mad frenzy; for the divine Krishna
began to play with him the old tricks He had played with the gopis. He
would tease and taunt, now and then revealing Himself, but always
keeping at a distance. Sri Ramakrishna\'s anguish brought on a return of
the old physical symptoms: the burning sensation, an oozing of blood
through the pores, a loosening of the joints, and the stopping of
physiological functions.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vaishnava scriptures advise one to propitiate Rādhā and obtain her
grace in order to realize Sri Krishna. So the tortured devotee now
turned his prayer to her. Within a short time he enjoyed her blessed
vision. He saw and felt the figure of Rādhā disappearing into his own
body.</strong></p>
<p><strong>He said later on: \"It is impossible to describe the heavenly beauty
and sweetness of Rādhā. Her very appearance showed that she had
completely forgotten herself in her passionate attachment to Krishna.
Her complexion was a light yellow.\"</strong></p>
<p><strong>Now one with Rādhā, he manifested the great ecstatic love, the
Mahā--bhāva which had found in her its fullest expression. Later Sri
Ramakrishna said: \"The manifestation in the same individual of the
nineteen different kinds of emotion for God is called, in the books on
bhakti, Mahā--bhāva. An ordinary man takes a whole lifetime to express
even a single one of these. But in this body [meaning himself] there
has been a complete manifestation of all nineteen.\"</strong></p>
<p><strong>The love of Rādhā is the precursor of the resplendent vision of Sri
Krishna, and Sri Ramakrishna soon experienced that vision. The
enchanting form of Krishna appeared to him and merged in his person. He
became Krishna; he totally forgot his own individuality and the world;
he saw Krishna in himself and in the universe. Thus he attained to the
fulfilment of the worship of the Personal God. He drank from the
fountain of Immortal Bliss. The agony of his heart vanished forever. He
realized Amrita, Immortality, beyond the shadow of death.</strong></p>
<p><strong>One day, listening to a recitation of the Bhāgavata on the verandah of
the Radhākānta temple he fell into a divine mood and saw the enchanting
form of Krishna. He perceived the luminous rays issuing from Krishna\'s
Lotus Feet in the form of a stout rope, which touched first the
Bhāgavata and then his own chest, connecting all three - God, the
scripture, and the devotee. \"After this vision,\" he used to say, \"I
came to realize that <em>Bhagavān--Bhakta--and--Bhāgavata</em> --
God--Devotee--and--Scripture -- are in reality, one and the same.\"</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Vedānta</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>The Brāhmani was the enthusiastic teacher and astonished beholder of
Sri Ramakrishna in his spiritual progress. She became proud of the
achievements of her unique pupil. But the pupil himself was not
permitted to rest; his destiny beckoned him forward. His Divine Mother
would allow him no respite till he had left behind the entire realm of
duality with its visions, experiences, and ecstatic dreams. But for the
new ascent the old tender guides would not suffice. The Brāhmani, on
whom he had depended for three years saw her son escape from her to
follow the command of a teacher with masculine strength, a sterner mien,
a gnarled physique, and</em></strong></p>
<p>a virile voice. The new guru was a wandering monk, the sturdy Totāpuri,
whom Sri Ramakrishna learnt to address affectionately as <em>Nangta,</em> the
\"Naked One\", because of his total renunciation of all earthly objects
and</p>
<p>attachments, including even a piece of wearing-cloth.</p>
<p>Totāpuri was the bearer of a philosophy new to Sri Ramakrishna, the
non-dualistic Vedānta philosophy, whose</p>
<p>conclusions Totāpuri had experienced in his own life. This ancient Hindu
system designates the Ultimate Reality as Brahman, also described as
<em>Satchidānanda,</em> Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute. Brahman is the only
Real</p>
<p>Existence. In It there is no time, no space, no causality, no
multiplicity. But through Māyā, Its inscrutable Power, time, space, and
causality are created and the One appears to break into the many. The
eternal Spirit appears as a manifold of individuals endowed with form
and subject to the conditions of time. The Immortal becomes a victim of
birth and death. The Changeless undergoes change. The sinless Pure Soul,
hypnotised by Its own Māyā, experiences the joys of heaven and the pains
of hell. But these experiences based on the duality of the
subject-object relationship are unreal. Even the vision of a Personal
God is, ultimately speaking, as illusory as the experience of any other
object. Man attains his liberation, therefore, by piercing the veil of
Māyā and rediscovering his total identity with Brahman. Knowing himself
to be one with the Universal Spirit, he realizes ineffable Peace. Only
then does he go beyond the fiction of birth and death; only then does he
become immortal. And this is the ultimate goal of all religions - to
dehypnotize the soul now hypnotized by its own ignorance.</p>
<p>The path of the Vedāntic discipline is the path of negation, <em>\"Neti\",</em>
in which, by stern determination, all that is unreal is both negated and
renounced. It is the path of jnāna, knowledge, the direct method of
realizing the Absolute. After the negation of everything relative,
including the discriminating ego itself, the aspirant merges in the One
without a Second, in the bliss of nirvikalpa Samādhi, where subject and
object are alike dissolved. The soul goes beyond the realm of thought.
The domain of duality is transcended. Māyā is left behind with all its
changes and modifications. The Real Man towers above the delusions of
creation, preservation, and destruction. An avalanche of indescribable
Bliss sweeps away all relative ideas of pain and pleasure, good and
evil. There shines in the heart the glory of the Eternal Brahman,
Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute. Knower, knowledge, and known are
dissolved in the Ocean of one eternal Consciousness; love, lover, and
beloved merge in the unbounded Sea of supreme Felicity; birth, growth,
and death vanish in infinite Existence. All doubts and misgivings are
quelled for ever; the oscillations of the mind are stopped; the momentum
of past actions is exhausted. Breaking down the ridge-pole of the
tabernacle in which the soul has made its abode for untold ages,
stilling the body, calming the mind, drowning the ego, the sweet joy of
Brahman wells up in that superconscious state. Space disappears into
nothingness, time is swallowed in eternity, and causation becomes a
dream of the past. Only Existence is. Ah! Who can describe what the soul
then feels in its communion with the Self?</p>
<p>Even when man descends from this dizzy height, he is devoid of ideas of
\"I\" and \"mine\"; he looks on the body as a mere shadow, an outer
sheath encasing the soul. He does not dwell on the past, takes no
thought for the future, and looks with indifference on the present. He
surveys everything in the world with an eye of equality; he is no longer
touched by the infinite variety of phenomena; he no longer reacts to
pleasure and pain. He remains unmoved whether he - that is to say, his
body - is worshipped by the good or tormented by the wicked; for he
realizes that it is the one Brahman that manifests Itself through
everything. The impact of such an experience devastates the body and
mind. Consciousness becomes blasted, as it were, with an excess of
Light. In the Vedānta books it is said that after the experience of
nirvikalpa Samādhi the body drops off like a dry leaf. Only those who
are born with a special mission for the world can return from this
height to the valleys of normal life. They live and move in the world
for the welfare of mankind. They are invested with a supreme spiritual
power. A divine glory shines through them.</p>
<p><strong>Totāpuri</strong></p>
<p>Totāpuri arrived at the Dakshineśwar temple garden toward the end of
1864. Perhaps born in the Punjab, he was the head of a monastery in that
province of India and claimed leadership of seven hundred sannyāsis.
Trained from early youth in the disciplines of the Advaita Vedānta, he
looked upon the world as an illusion. The</p>
<p>gods and goddesses of the dualistic worship were to him mere fantasies
of the deluded mind. Prayers, ceremonies, rites, and rituals had nothing
to do with true religion, and about these he was utterly indifferent.
Exercising self-exertion and unshakable will-power, he had liberated
himself from attachment to the sense-objects of the relative universe.
For forty years he had practised austere discipline on the bank of the
sacred Narmada and had finally realized his identity with the Absolute.
Thenceforward he roamed in the world as an unfettered soul, a lion free
from the cage. Clad in a loin-cloth, he spent his days under the canopy
of the sky alike in storm and sunshine, feeding his body on the slender
pittance of alms. He had been visiting the estuary of the Ganges. On his
return journey along the bank of the sacred river, led by the
inscrutable Divine Will, he stopped at Dakshineśwar.</p>
<p>Totāpuri, discovering at once that Sri Ramakrishna was prepared to be a
student of Vedānta, asked to initiate him into its mysteries. With the
permission of the Divine Mother, Sri Ramakrishna agreed to the proposal.
But Totāpuri explained that only a sannyāsi could receive the teaching
of Vedānta. Sri Ramakrishna agreed to renounce the world, but with the
stipulation that the ceremony of his initiation into the monastic order
be performed in secret, to spare the feelings of his old mother, who had
been living with him at Dakshineśwar.</p>
<p>On the appointed day, in the small hours of the morning, a fire was
lighted in the Panchavati. Totāpuri and Sri Ramakrishna sat before it.
The flame played on their faces. \"Ramakrishna was a small brown man
with a short beard and beautiful eyes, long dark eyes, full of light,
obliquely set and slightly veiled, never very wide open, but seeing
half-closed a great distance both outwardly and inwardly. His mouth was
open over his white teeth in a bewitching smile, at once affectionate
and mischievous. Of medium height, he was thin to emaciation and
extremely delicate. His temperament was high-strung, for he was
supersensitive to all the winds of joy and sorrow, both moral and
physical. He was indeed a living reflection of all that happened before
the mirror of his eyes, a two-sided mirror, turned both out and in.\"
Facing him, the other rose like a rock. He was very tall and robust, a
sturdy and tough oak. His constitution and mind were of iron. He was the
strong leader of men.</p>
<p>In the burning flame before him Sri Ramakrishna performed the rituals of
destroying his attachment to relatives, friends, body, mind,
sense-organs, ego, and the world. The leaping flame swallowed it all,
making the initiate free and pure. The sacred thread and the tuft of
hair were consigned to the fire, completing his severance from caste,
sex, and society. Last of all he burnt in that fire, with all that is
holy as his witness, his desire for enjoyment here and hereafter. He
uttered the sacred mantras giving assurance of safety and fearlessness
to all beings, who were only manifestations of his own Self. The rites
completed, the disciple received from the guru the loincloth and ochre
robe, the emblems of his new life.</p>
<p>The teacher and the disciple repaired to the meditation room near by.
Totāpuri began to impart to Sri Ramakrishna the great truths of Vedānta.
\"Brahman\", he said, \"is the only Reality, ever pure, ever illumined,
ever free, beyond the limits of time, space, and causation. Though
apparently divided by names and forms through the inscrutable power of
Māyā, that enchantress who makes the impossible possible, Brahman is
really One and undivided. When a seeker merges in the beatitude of
Samādhi, he does not perceive time and space or name and form, the
offspring of Māyā. Whatever is within the domain of Māyā is unreal. Give
it up. Destroy the prison-house of name and form and rush out of it with
the strength of a lion. Dive deep in search of the Self and realize It
through Samādhi. You will find the world of name and form vanishing into
void, and the puny ego dissolving in Brahman-Consciousness. You will
realize your identity with Brahman, Existence-Knowledge-Bliss
Absolute.\" Quoting the Upanishad, Totāpuri said \"That knowledge is
shallow by which one sees or hears or knows another. What is shallow is
worthless and can never give real felicity. But the Knowledge by which
one does not see another or hear another or know another, which is
beyond duality, is great, and through such Knowledge one attains the
Infinite Bliss. How can the mind and senses grasp That which shines in
the heart of all as the Eternal Subject?\"</p>
<p>Totāpuri asked the disciple to withdraw his mind from all objects of
relative world, including the gods and goddesses, and to concentrate on
the Absolute. But the task was not easy even for Sri Ramakrishna. He
found it impossible to take his mind beyond Kāli, the Divine Mother of
the Universe. \"After the initiation\", Sri Ramakrishna once said,
describing the event, \"Nangta began to teach me the various conclusions
of the</p>
<p>Advaita Vedānta and asked me to withdraw the mind completely from all
objects and dive deep into the Ātman. But in spite of all my attempts I
could not altogether cross the realm of name and form and bring my mind
to the unconditioned state. I had no difficulty in taking the mind from
all the objects of the world. But the radiant and too familiar figure of
the Blissful Mother, the Embodiment of the essence of Pure
Consciousness, appeared before me as a living reality. Her bewitching
smile prevented me from passing into the Great Beyond. Again and again I
tried, but She stood in my way every time. In despair I said to Nangta:
\'It is hopeless. I cannot raise my mind to the unconditioned state and
come face to face with Ātman.\' He grew excited and sharply said:
\'What? You can\'t do it? But you have to.\' He cast his eyes around.
Finding a piece of glass he took it up and stuck it between my eyebrows.
\'Concentrate the mind on this point!\' he thundered. Then with stern
determination I again sat to meditate. As soon as the gracious form of
the Divine Mother appeared before me, I used my discrimination as a
sword and with it clove Her in two. The last barrier fell. My spirit at
once soared beyond the relative plane and I lost myself in Samādhi.\"</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna remained completely absorbed in Samādhi for three days.
\"Is it really true?\" Totāpuri cried out in astonishment. \"Is it
possible that he has attained in a single day what it took me forty
years of strenuous practice to achieve? Great God! It is nothing short
of a miracle!\" With the help of Totāpuri, Sri Ramakrishna\'s mind
finally came down to the relative Plane.</p>
<p>Totāpuri, a monk of the most orthodox type, never stayed at a place more
than three days. But he remained at Dakshineśwar eleven months. He too
had something to learn.</p>
<p>Totāpuri had no idea of the struggles of ordinary men in the toils of
passion and desire. Having maintained all through life the guilelessness
of a child, he laughed at the idea of a man\'s being led astray by the
senses. He was convinced that the world, was Māyā and had only to be
denounced to vanish for ever. A born non-dualist, he had no faith in a
Personal God. He did not believe in the terrible aspect of Kāli, much
less in Her benign aspect. Music and the chanting of God\'s holy name
were to him only so much nonsense. He ridiculed the spending of emotion
on the worship of a Personal God.</p>
<p><strong>Kāli and Māyā</strong></p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna, on the other hand, though fully aware, like his guru,
that the world is an illusory appearance, instead of slighting Māyā,
like an orthodox monist, acknowledged its power in the relative life. He
was all love and reverence for Māyā, perceiving in it a mysterious and
majestic expression of Divinity. To him Māyā itself was God, for
everything was God. It was one of the faces of Brahman. What he had
realized on the heights of the transcendental plane, he also found here
below, everywhere about him, under the mysterious garb of names and
forms. And this garb was a perfectly transparent sheath, through which
he recognized the glory of the Divine Immanence. Māyā, the mighty weaver
of the garb, is none other than Kāli, the Divine Mother. She is the
primordial Divine Energy, Śakti, and She can no more be distinguished
from the Supreme Brahman than can the power of burning be distinguished
from fire. She projects the world and again withdraws it. She spins it
as the spider spins its web. She is the Mother of the Universe,
identical with the Brahman of Vedānta, and with the Ātman of Yoga. As
eternal Lawgiver, She makes and unmakes laws; it is by Her imperious
will that karma yields its fruit. She ensnares men with illusion and
again releases them from bondage with a look of Her benign eyes. She is
the supreme Mistress of the cosmic play, and all objects, animate and
inanimate, dance by Her will. Even those who realize the Absolute in
nirvikalpa Samādhi are under Her jurisdiction as long as they still live
on the relative plane.</p>
<p>Thus, after Nirvikalpa Samādhi, Sri Ramakrishna realized Māyā in an
altogether new role. The binding aspect of Kāli vanished from before his
vision. She no longer obscured his understanding. The world became the
glorious manifestation of the Divine Mother. Māyā became Brahman. The
Transcendental Itself broke through the Immanent. Sri Ramakrishna
discovered that Māyā operates in the relative world in two ways, and he
termed these \"Avidyā--Māyā\" and \"Vidyā--Māyā\". Avidyā--Māyā
represents the dark forces of creation: sensuous desires, evil passions,
greed, lust, cruelty, and so on. It sustains the world system on the
lower planes. It is responsible for the round of man\'s birth and death.
It must be fought and vanquished. But Vidyā--Māyā is the higher force of
creation: the spiritual virtues, the enlightening qualities, kindness,
purity, love, devotion. Vidyā--</p>
<p><em>Bhāva--</em></p>
<p>Māyā elevates man to the higher planes of consciousness. With the help
of Vidyā--Māyā the devotee rids himself of Avidyā--Māyā; he then becomes
<em>Māyātita</em>, free of Māyā. The two aspects of Māyā are the two forces</p>
<p>of creation, the two powers of Kāli; and She stands beyond them both.
She is like the effulgent sun, bringing into existence and shining
through and standing behind the clouds of different colours and shapes,
conjuring up wonderful forms in the blue autumn heaven.</p>
<p>The Divine Mother asked Sri Ramakrishna not to be lost in the
featureless Absolute but to remain in</p>
<p><em>mukha,</em> on the threshold of relative consciousness, the border line
between the Absolute and the Relative. He was to keep himself at the
\"sixth centre\" of Tantra, from which he could see not only the glory
of the seventh, but also the divine manifestations of the Kundalini in
the lower centres. He gently oscillated back and forth across the
dividing line. Ecstatic devotion to the Divine Mother alternated with
serene absorption in the Ocean of Absolute Unity. He thus bridged the
gulf between the Personal and the Impersonal, the immanent and the
transcendent aspects of Reality. This is a unique experience in the
recorded spiritual history of the world.</p>
<p><strong>Totāpuri\'s Lesson</strong></p>
<p>From Sri Ramakrishna Totāpuri had to learn the significance of Kāli, the
Great Fact of the relative world, and of Māyā, Her indescribable Power.</p>
<p>One day, when guru and disciple were engaged in an animated discussion
about Vedānta, a servant of the temple garden came there and took a coal
from the sacred fire that had been lighted by the great ascetic. He
wanted it to light his tobacco. Totāpuri flew into a rage and was about
to beat the man. Sri Ramakrishna rocked with laughter. \"What a shame!\"
he cried. \"You are explaining to me the reality of Brahman and the
illusoriness of the world; yet now you have so far forgotten yourself as
to be about to beat a man in a fit of passion. The power of Māyā is
indeed inscrutable!\" Totāpuri was embarrassed.</p>
<p>About this time Totāpuri was suddenly laid up with a severe attack of
dysentery. On account of this miserable illness he found it impossible
to meditate. One night the pain became excruciating. He could no longer
concentrate on Brahman. The body stood in the way. He became incensed
with its demands. A free soul, he did not at all care for the body. So
he determined to drown it in the Ganges. Thereupon he walked into the
river. But, lo! He walks to the other bank. Is there not enough water in
the Ganges? Standing dumbfounded on the other bank he looks back across
the water. The trees, the temples, the houses, are silhouetted against
the sky. Suddenly, in one dazzling moment, he sees on all sides the
presence of the Divine Mother. She is in everything; She is everything.
She is in the water; She is on land. She is the body; She is the mind.
She is pain; She is comfort. She is knowledge; She is ignorance. She is
life; She is death. She is everything that one sees, hears, or imagines.
She turns \"yea\" into \"nay\", and \"nay\" into \"yea\". Without Her
grace no embodied being can go beyond Her realm. Man has no free will.
He is not even free to die. Yet, again, beyond the body and mind She
resides in Her Transcendental Absolute aspect. She is the Brahman that
Totāpuri had been worshipping all his life.</p>
<p>Totāpuri returned to Dakshineśwar and spent the remaining hours of the
night meditating on the Divine Mother. In the morning he went to the
Kāli temple with Sri Ramakrishna and prostrated himself before the image
of the Mother. He now realized why he had spent eleven months at
Dakshineśwar. Bidding farewell to the disciple, he continued on his way,
enlightened.</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna later described the significance of Totāpuri\'s lessons:
\"When I think of the Supreme Being as inactive - neither creating nor
preserving nor destroying -, I call Him Brahman or <em>Purusha,</em> the
Impersonal God. When I think of Him as active - creating, preserving,
and destroying -, I call Him Śakti or Māyā or <em>Prakriti,</em> the Personal
God. But the distinction between them does not mean a difference. The
Personal and the Impersonal are the same thing, like milk and its
whiteness, the diamond and its lustre, the snake and its wriggling
motion. It is impossible to conceive of the one without the other. The
Divine Mother and Brahman are one.\"</p>
<p>After the departure of Totāpuri, Sri Ramakrishna remained for six months
in a state of absolute identity with Brahman. \"For six months at a
stretch\", he said, \"I remained in that state from which ordinary men
can never</p>
<p>return; generally the body falls off, after three weeks, like a sere
leaf. I was not conscious of day and night. Flies would enter my mouth
and nostrils just as they do a dead body\'s, but I did not feel them. My
hair became matted with dust.\"</p>
<p>His body would not have survived but for the kindly attention of a monk
who happened to be at Dakshineśwar at that time and who somehow realized
that for the good of humanity Sri Ramakrishna\'s body must be preserved.
He tried various means, even physical violence, to recall the fleeing
soul to the prison-house of the body, and during the resultant fleeting
moments of consciousness he would push a few morsels of food down Sri
Ramakrishna\'s throat. Presently Sri Ramakrishna received the command of
the Divine Mother to remain on the threshold of relative consciousness.
Soon thereafter he was afflicted with a serious attack of dysentery. Day
and night the pain tortured him, and his mind gradually came down to the
physical plane.</p>
<p><strong>Company of Holy Men and Devotees</strong></p>
<p>From now on Sri Ramakrishna began to seek the company of devotees and
holy men. He had gone through the storm and stress of spiritual
disciplines and visions. Now he realized an inner calmness and appeared
to others as a normal person. But he could not bear the company of
worldly people or listen to their talk. Fortunately the holy atmosphere
of Dakshineśwar and the liberality of Mathur attracted monks and holy
men from all parts of the country. <em>Sādhus</em> of all denominations -
monists and dualists, Vaishnavas and Vedāntists, Śāktās and worshippers
of Rāmā - flocked there in ever increasing numbers. Ascetics and
visionaries came to seek Sri Ramakrishna\'s advice. Vaishnavas had come
during the period of his Vaishnava sādhana, and Tāntriks when he
practised the disciplines of Tantra. Vedāntists began to arrive after
the departure of Totāpuri. In the room of Sri Ramakrishna, who was then
in bed with dysentery, the Vedāntists engaged in scriptural discussions,
and, forgetting his own physical suffering, he solved their doubts by
referring directly to his own experiences. Many of the visitors were
genuine spiritual souls, the unseen pillars of Hinduism, and their
spiritual lives were quickened in no small measure by the sage of
Dakshineśwar. Sri Ramakrishna in turn learnt from them anecdotes
concerning the ways and the conduct of holy men, which he subsequently
narrated to his devotees and disciples. At his request Mathur provided
him with large stores of foodstuffs, clothes, and so forth, for
distribution among the wandering monks.</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna had not read books, yet he possessed an encyclopaedic
knowledge of religions and religious philosophies. This he acquired from
his contacts with innumerable holy men and scholars. He had a unique
power of assimilation; through meditation he made this knowledge a part
of his being. Once, when he was asked by a disciple about the source of
his seemingly inexhaustible knowledge, he replied: \"I have not read;
but I have heard the learned. I have made a garland of their knowledge,
wearing it round my neck, and I have given it as an offering at the feet
of the Mother.\"</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna used to say that when the flower blooms the bees come to
it for honey of their own accord. Now many souls began to visit
Dakshineśwar to satisfy their spiritual hunger. He, the devotee and
aspirant, became the Master. Gauri, the great scholar who had been one
of the first to proclaim Sri Ramakrishna an Incarnation of God, paid the
Master a visit in 1870 and with the Master\'s blessings renounced the
world. Nārāyan Śāstri, another great pundit, who had mastered the six
systems of Hindu philosophy and had been offered a lucrative post by the
Maharaja of Jaipur, met the Master and recognized in him one who had
realized in life those ideals which he himself had encountered merely in
books. Sri Ramakrishna initiated Nārāyan Śastri, at his earnest request,
into the life of sannyās. Pundit Padmalochan, the court pundit of the
Maharaja of Burdwan, well known for his scholarship in both the Vedānta
and the <em>Nyāya</em> systems of philosophy, accepted the Master as an
Incarnation of God. Krishnakishore, a Vedantist scholar, became devoted
to the Master. And there arrived Viśwanāth Upādhyāya, who was to become
a favourite devotee; Sri Ramakrishna always addressed him as
\"Captain\". He was a high officer of the King of Nepal and had received
the title of Colonel in recognition of his merit. A scholar of the Gita,
the Bhāgavata, and the Vedānta philosophy, he daily performed the
worship of his Chosen Deity with great devotion. \"I have read the Vedas
and the other scriptures\", he said. \"I have also met a good many monks
and devotees in different places. But it is in Sri Ramakrishna\'s
presence that my spiritual yearnings have been fulfilled. To me he seems
to be the embodiment of the truths of the</p>
<p>scriptures.\"</p>
<p>The Knowledge of Brahman in nirvikalpa Samādhi had convinced Sri
Ramakrishna that the gods of the different religions are but so many
readings of the Absolute, and that the Ultimate Reality could never be
expressed by human tongue. He understood that all religions lead their
devotees by differing paths to one and the same goal. Now he became
eager to explore some of the alien religions; for with him understanding
meant actual experience.</p>
<p><strong>Islām</strong></p>
<p>Toward the end of 1866 he began to practise the disciplines of Islām.
Under the direction of his Mussalman guru he abandoned himself to his
new sādhana. He dressed as a Mussalman and repeated the name of Allah.</p>
<p>His prayers took the form of the Islamic devotions. He forgot the Hindu
gods and goddesses - even Kāli - and gave up visiting the temples. He
took up his residence outside the temple precincts. After three days he
saw the vision of a radiant figure, perhaps Mohammed. This figure gently
approached him and finally lost himself in Sri Ramakrishna. Thus he
realized the Mussalman God. Thence he passed into communion with
Brahman. The mighty river of Islam also led him back to the Ocean of the
Absolute.</p>
<p><strong>Christianity</strong></p>
<p>Eight years later, some time in November 1874, Sri Ramakrishna was
seized with an irresistible desire to learn the truth of the Christian
religion. He began to listen to readings from the Bible, by Śambhu
Charan Mallick, a gentleman of Calcutta and a devotee of the Master. Sri
Ramakrishna became fascinated by the life and teachings of Jesus. One
day he was seated in the parlour of Jadu Mallick\'s garden house at
Dakshineśwar, when his eyes became fixed on a painting of the Madonna
and Child. Intently watching it, he became gradually overwhelmed with
divine emotion. The figures in the picture took on life, and the rays of
light emanating from them entered his soul. The effect of this
experience was stronger than that of the vision of Mohammed. In dismay
he cried out, \"O Mother! What are You doing to me?\" And, breaking
through the barriers of creed and religion, he entered a new realm of
ecstasy. Christ possessed his soul. For three days he did not set foot
in the Kāli temple. On the fourth day, in the afternoon, as he was
walking in the Panchavati, he saw coming toward him a person with
beautiful large eyes, serene countenance, and fair skin. As the two
faced each other, a voice rang out in the depths of Sri Ramakrishna\'s
soul: \"Behold the Christ who shed His heart\'s blood for the redemption
of the world, who suffered a sea of anguish for love of men. It is He,
the Master Yogi, who is in eternal union with God. It is Jesus, Love
Incarnate.\" The Son of Man embraced the Son of the Divine Mother and
merged in him. Sri Ramakrishna realized his identity with Christ, as he
had already realized his identity with Kāli, Rāmā, Hanuman, Rādhā,
Krishna, Brahman, and Mohammed. The Master went into Samādhi and
communed with the Brahman with attributes. Thus he experienced the truth
that Christianity, too, was a path leading to God-Consciousness. Till
the last moment of his life he believed that Christ was an Incarnation
of God. But Christ, for him, was not the only Incarnation; there were
others - Buddha, for instance, and Krishna.</p>
<p><strong>Attitude toward Different Religions</strong></p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna accepted the divinity of Buddha and used to point out
the similarity of his teachings to those of the Upanishads. He also
showed great respect for the Tirthankarās, who founded Jainism, and for
the ten Gurus of Sikhism. But he did not speak of them as Divine
Incarnations. He was heard to say that the Gurus of Sikhism were the
reincarnations of King Janaka of ancient India. He kept in his room at
Dakshineśwar a small statue of Tirthankara Mahāvira and a picture of
Christ, before which incense was burnt morning and evening.</p>
<p>Without being formally initiated into their doctrines, Sri Ramakrishna
thus realized the ideals of religions other than Hinduism. He did not
need to follow any doctrine. All barriers were removed by his
overwhelming love of God. So he became a Master who could speak with
authority regarding the ideas and ideals of the various religions of the
world. \"I have practised\", said he, \"all religions - Hinduism, Islam,
Christianity - and I have also followed the paths of the different Hindu
sects. I have found that it is the same God toward whom all are
directing their steps, though along different paths. You must try all
beliefs and traverse all the different ways once. Wherever I look, I see
men quarrelling in the name of religion - Hindus, Mohammedans, Brahmos,</p>
<p>Vaishnavās, and the rest. But they never reflect that He who is called
Krishna is also called Śiva, and bears the</p>
<p>name of the Primal Energy, Jesus, and Allah as well - the same Rāmā with
a thousand names. A lake has several G<em>hāts</em>. At one, the Hindus take
water in pitchers and call it <em>\'Jal\'</em>; at another the Mussalmans take
water in leather bags and call it <em>\'pāni\'</em>. At a third the Christians
call it <em>\'water\'</em>. Can we imagine that it is not \'jal\', but</p>
<p>only \'pāni\' or \'water\'? How ridiculous! The substance is One under
different names, and everyone is seeking the same substance; only
climate, temperament, and name create differences. Let each man follow
his own path. If he sincerely and ardently wishes to know God, peace be
unto him! He will surely realize Him.\"</p>
<p>In 1867, Sri Ramakrishna returned to Kāmārpukur to recuperate from the
effect of his austerities. The peaceful countryside, the simple and
artless companions of his boyhood, and the pure air did him much good.
The villagers were happy to get back their playful, frank, witty,
kind-hearted, and truthful Gadādhar, though they did not fail to notice
the great change that had come over him during his years in Calcutta.
His wife, Sāradā Devi, now fourteen years old, soon arrived at
Kāmārpukur. Her spiritual development was much beyond her age and she
was able to understand immediately her husband\'s state of mind. She
became eager to learn from him about God and to live with him as his
attendant. The Master accepted her cheerfully both as his disciple and
as his spiritual companion. Referring to the experiences of these few
days, she once said: \"I used to feel always as if a pitcher full of
bliss were placed in my heart. The joy was indescribable.\"</p>
<p><strong>Pilgrimage</strong></p>
<p>On January 27, 1868, Mathur Bābu with a party of some one hundred and
twenty-five persons set out on a pilgrimage to the sacred places of
northern India. At Vaidyanāth in Behar, when the Master saw the
inhabitants of a village reduced by poverty and starvation to mere
skeletons, he requested his rich patron to feed the people and give each
a piece of cloth. Mathur demurred at the added expense. The Master
declared bitterly that he would not go on to Banāras, but would live
with the poor and share their miseries. He actually left Mathur and sat
down with the villagers.</p>
<p>Whereupon Mathur had to yield. On another occasion, two years later, Sri
Ramakrishna showed a similar sentiment for the poor and needy. He
accompanied Mathur on a tour to one of the latter\'s estates at the time
of the collection of rents. For two years the harvests had failed and
the tenants were in a state of extreme poverty. The Master asked Mathur
to remit their rents, distribute help to them, and in addition give the
hungry people a sumptuous feast. When Mathur grumbled, the Master said:
\"You are only the steward of the Divine Mother. They are the Mother\'s
tenants. You must spend the Mother\'s money. When they are suffering,
how can you refuse to help them? You must help them.\" Again Mathur had
to give in. Sri Ramakrishna\'s sympathy for the poor sprang from his
perception of God in all created beings. His sentiment was not that of
the humanist or philanthropist. To him the service of man was the same
as the worship of God.</p>
<p>The party entered holy Banāras by boat along the Ganges. When Sri
Ramakrishna\'s eyes fell on this city of Śiva, where had accumulated for
ages the devotion and piety of countless worshippers, he saw it to be
made of gold, as the scriptures declare. He was visibly moved. During
his stay in the city he treated every particle of its earth with utmost
respect. At the Manikarnikā Ghāt, the great cremation ground of the
city, he actually saw Śiva, with ash-covered body and tawny matted hair,
serenely approaching each funeral pyre and breathing into the ears of
the corpses the mantra of liberation; and then the Divine Mother
removing from the dead their bonds. Thus he realized the significance of
the scriptural statement that anyone dying in Banāras attains salvation
through the grace of Śiva. He paid a visit to Trailanga Swāmi, the
celebrated monk, whom he later declared to be a real paramahamsa, a
veritable image of Śiva.</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna visited Allahābad, at the confluence of the Ganges and
the Jamuna, and then proceeded to Vrindāvan and Mathura, hallowed by the
legends, songs, and dramas about Krishna and the gopis. Here he had
numerous visions and his heart overflowed with divine emotion. He wept
and said: \"O Krishna! Everything here is as it was in the olden days.
You alone are absent.\" He visited the great woman saint Gangāmāyi,
regarded by Vaishnava devotees as the reincarnation of an intimate
attendant of Rādhā. She was sixty years old and had frequent trances.
She spoke of Sri Ramakrishna as an incarnation of Rādhā. With great
difficulty he was persuaded to leave her.</p>
<p>On the return journey Mathur wanted to visit Gayā, but Sri Ramakrishna
declined to go. He recalled his father\'s vision at Gayā before his own
birth and felt that in the temple of Vishnu he would become permanently
absorbed in God. Mathur, honouring the Master\'s wish, returned with his
party to Calcutta.</p>
<p>From Vrindāvan the Master had brought a handful of dust. Part of this he
scattered in the Panchavati; the rest he buried in the little hut where
he had practised meditation. \"Now this place\", he said, \"is as sacred
as Vrindāvan.\"</p>
<p>In 1870 the Master went on a pilgrimage to Nadia, the birth-place of Sri
Chaitanya. As the boat by which he travelled approached the sand-bank
close to Nadia, Sri Ramakrishna had a vision of the \"two brothers\",
Sri Chaitanya and his companion Nityānanda, \"bright as molten gold\"
and with haloes, rushing to greet him with uplifted hands. \"There they
come! There they come!\" he cried. They entered his body and he went
into a deep trance.</p>
<p><strong>Relation with His Wife</strong></p>
<p>In 1872, Sāradā Devi paid her first visit to her husband at
Dakshineśwar. Four years earlier she had seen him at Kāmārpukur and had
tasted the bliss of his divine company. Since then she had become even
more gentle, tender, introspective, serious, and unselfish. She had
heard many rumours about her husband\'s insanity. People had shown her
pity in her misfortune. The more she thought, the more she felt that her
duty was to be with him, giving him, in whatever measure she could, a
wife\'s devoted service. She was now eighteen years old. Accompanied by
her father, she arrived at Dakshineśwar, having come on foot the
distance of eighty miles. She had had an attack of fever on the way.
When she arrived at the temple garden the Master said sorrowfully: \"Ah!
You have come too late. My Mathur is no longer here to look after you.\"
Mathur had passed away the previous year.</p>
<p>The Master took up the duty of instructing his young wife, and this
included everything from housekeeping to the Knowledge of Brahman. He
taught her how to trim a lamp, how to behave toward people according to
their differing temperaments, and how to conduct herself before
visitors. He instructed her in the mysteries of spiritual life - prayer,
meditation, japa, deep contemplation, and Samādhi. The first lesson that
Sāradā Devi received was: \"God is everybody\'s Beloved, just as the
moon is dear to every child. Everyone has the same right to pray to Him.
Out of His grace He reveals Himself to all who call upon Him. You too
will see Him if you but pray to Him.\"</p>
<p>Totāpuri, coming to know of the Master\'s marriage, had once remarked:
\"What does it matter? He alone is firmly established in the Knowledge
of Brahman who can adhere to his spirit of discrimination and
renunciation even while living with his wife. He alone has attained the
supreme illumination who can look on man and woman alike as Brahman. A
man with the idea of sex may be a good aspirant, but he is still far
from the goal.\" Sri Ramakrishna and his wife lived together at
Dakshineśwar, but their minds always soared above the worldly plane. A
few months after Sāradā Devi\'s arrival Sri Ramakrishna arranged, on an
auspicious day, a special worship of Kāli, the Divine Mother. Instead of
an image of the Deity, he placed on the seat the living image, Sāradā
Devi herself. The worshipper and the worshipped went into deep Samādhi
and in the transcendental plane their souls were united. After several
hours Sri Ramakrishna came down again to the relative plane, sang a hymn
to the Great Goddess, and surrendered, at the feet of the living image,
himself, his rosary, and the fruit of his life-long sādhana. This is
known in Tantra as the <em>Shodasi Puja,</em> the \"Adoration of Woman\". Sri
Ramakrishna realized the significance of the great statement of the
Upanishad: \"O Lord, Thou art the woman, Thou art the man; Thou art the
boy, Thou art the girl; Thou art the old, tottering on their crutches.
Thou pervadest the universe in its multiple forms.\"</p>
<p>By his marriage Sri Ramakrishna admitted the great value of marriage in
man\'s spiritual evolution, and by adhering to his monastic vows he
demonstrated the imperative necessity of self-control, purity, and
continence, in the realization of God. By his unique spiritual
relationship with his wife he proved that husband and wife can live
together as spiritual companions. Thus his life is a synthesis of the
ways of life of the householder and the</p>
<p>monk.</p>
<p><strong>The \"Ego\" of the Master</strong></p>
<p>In the nirvikalpa Samādhi Sri Ramakrishna had realized that Brahman
alone is real and the world illusory. By</p>
<p>keeping his mind six months on the plane of the non-dual Brahman, he had
attained to the state of the <em>Vijnani,</em> the Knower of Truth in a special
and very rich sense, who sees Brahman not only in himself and in the</p>
<p>transcendental Absolute, but in everything of the world. In this state
of <em>Vijnāna,</em> sometimes, bereft of body-consciousness, he would regard
himself as one with Brahman; sometimes, conscious of the dual world, he
would regard himself as God\'s devotee, servant, or child. In order to
enable the Master to work for the welfare of humanity, the Divine Mother
had kept in him a trace of ego, which he described - according to his
mood - as the \"ego of Knowledge\", the \"ego of Devotion\", the \"ego
of a child\", or the \"ego of a servant\". In any case this ego of the
Master, consumed by the fire of the Knowledge of Brahman, was an
appearance only, like a burnt string. He often referred to this ego as
the \"ripe ego\" in contrast with the ego of the bound soul, which he
described as the \"unripe\" or \"green\" ego. The ego of the bound soul
identifies itself with the body, relatives, possessions, and the world;
but the \"ripe ego\", illumined by Divine Knowledge, knows the body,
relatives, possessions, and the world to be unreal and establishes a
relationship of love with God alone. Through this \"ripe ego\" Sri
Ramakrishna dealt with the world and his wife. One day, while stroking
his feet, Sāradā Devi asked the Master, \"What do you think of me?\"
Quick came the answer: \"The Mother who is worshipped in the temple is
the mother who has given birth to my body and is now living in the
Nahabat, and it is She again who is stroking my feet at this moment.
Indeed, I always look on you as the personification of the Blissful
Mother Kāli.\"</p>
<p>Sāradā Devi, in the company of her husband, had rare spiritual
experiences. She said: \"I have no words to describe my wonderful
exaltation of spirit as I watched him in his different moods. Under the
influence of divine emotion he would sometimes talk on abstruse
subjects, sometimes laugh, sometimes weep, and sometimes become
perfectly motionless in Samādhi. This would continue throughout the
night. There was such an extraordinary divine presence in him that now
and then I would shake with fear and wonder how the night would pass.
Months went by in this way. Then one day he discovered that I had to
keep awake the whole night lest, during my sleep, he should go into
Samādhi - for it might happen at any moment -, and so he asked me to
sleep in the Nahabat.\"</p>
<p><strong>Summary of the Master\'s Spiritual Experiences</strong></p>
<p>We have now come to the end of Sri Ramakrishna\'s sādhana, the period of
his spiritual discipline. As a result of his supersensuous experiences
he reached certain conclusions regarding himself and spirituality in
general. His conclusions about himself may be summarised as follows:</p>
<p>First, he was an Incarnation of God, a specially commissioned person,
whose spiritual experiences were for the benefit of humanity. Whereas it
takes an ordinary man a whole life\'s struggle to realize one or two
phases of God, he had in a few years realized God in all His phases.</p>
<p>Second, he knew that he had always been a free soul, that the various
disciplines through which he had passed were really not necessary for
his own liberation but were solely for the benefit of others. Thus the
terms liberation and bondage were not applicable to him. As long as
there are beings who consider themselves bound, God must come down to
earth as an Incarnation to free them from bondage, just as a magistrate
must visit any part of his district in which there is trouble.</p>
<p>Third, he came to foresee the time of his death. His words with respect
to this matter were literally fulfilled.</p>
<p><strong>About spirituality in general the following were his conclusions :</strong></p>
<p>First, he was firmly convinced that all religions are true, that every
doctrinal system represents a path to God. He had followed all the main
paths and all had led him to the same goal. He was the first religious
prophet recorded in history to preach the harmony of religions.</p>
<p>Second, the three great systems of thought known as Dualism, Qualified
Non-dualism, and Absolute Non-dualism <em>- Dvaita, Visishtādvaita, and
Advaita -</em> he perceived to represent three stages in man\'s progress
toward</p>
<p>the Ultimate Reality. They were not contradictory but complementary and
suited to different temperaments. For the ordinary man with strong
attachment to the senses, a dualistic form of religion, prescribing a
certain amount of material support, such as music and other symbols, is
useful. A man of God-realization transcends the idea of worldly duties,
but the ordinary mortal must perform his duties, striving to be
unattached and to surrender the results to God. The mind can comprehend
and describe the range of thought and experience up to the
Viśiśtādvaita, and no further. The Advaita, the last word in spiritual
experience, is something to be felt in Samādhi, for it transcends mind
and speech. From the highest standpoint, the Absolute and Its
manifestation are equally real - the Lord\'s Name, His Abode, and the
Lord Himself are of the same spiritual Essence. Everything is Spirit,
the difference being only in form.</p>
<p>Third, Sri Ramakrishna realized the wish of the Divine Mother that
through him She should found a new Order, consisting of those who would
uphold the universal doctrines illustrated in his life.</p>
<p>Fourth, his spiritual insight told him that those who were having their
last birth on the mortal plane of existence and those who had sincerely
called on the Lord even once in their lives must come to him.</p>
<p>During this period Sri Ramakrishna suffered several bereavements. The
first was the death of a nephew named, Akshay. After the young man\'s
death Sri Ramakrishna said: \"Akshay died before my very eyes. But it
did not affect me in the least. I stood by and watched a man die. It was
like a sword being drawn from its scabbard. I enjoyed the scene, and
laughed and sang and danced over it. They removed the body and cremated
it. But the next day as I stood there (pointing to the southeast
verandah of his room), I felt a racking pain for the loss of Akshay, as
if somebody were squeezing my heart like a wet towel. I wondered at it
and thought that the Mother was teaching me a lesson. I was not much
concerned even with my own body - much less with a relative. But if such
was my pain at the loss of a nephew, how much more must be the grief of
the householders at the loss of their near and dear ones!\" In 1871
Mathur died, and some five years later Śambhu Mallick - who, after
Mathur\'s passing away, had taken care of the Master\'s comfort. In 1873
died his elder brother Rāmeśwar, and in 1876, his beloved mother. These
bereavements left their imprint on the tender human heart of Sri
Ramakrishna albeit he had realized the immortality of the soul and the
illusoriness of birth and death.</p>
<p>In March 1875, about a year before the death of his mother, the Master
met Keshab Chandra Sen. The meeting was a momentous event for both Sri
Ramakrishna and Keshab. Here the Master for the first time came into
actual contact with a worthy representative of modern India.</p>
<p><strong>Brāhmo Samāj</strong></p>
<p>Keshab was the leader of the Brāhmo Samāj, one of the two great
movements that, during the latter part of the nineteenth century, played
an important part in shaping the course of the renascence of India. The
founder of the Brāhmo movement had been the great Rājā Rāmmohan Roy
(1774-1833). Though born in an orthodox brāhmin family, Rāmmohan Roy had
shown great sympathy for Islam and Christianity. He had gone to Tibet in
search of the Buddhist mysteries. He had extracted from Christianity its
ethical system, but had rejected the divinity of Christ as he had denied
the Hindu Incarnations. The religion of Islam influenced him, to a great
extent, in the formulation of his monotheistic doctrines. But he always
went back to the Vedas for his spiritual inspiration. The Brāhmo Samāj,
which he founded in 1828, was dedicated to the \"worship and adoration
of the Eternal, the Unsearchable, the Immutable Being, who is the Author
and Preserver of the Universe\". The Samāj was open to all without
distinction of colour, creed, caste, nation, or religion.</p>
<p>The real organizer of the Samāj was Devendranāth Tāgore (1817-1905), the
father of the poet Rabindranāth. His physical and spiritual beauty,
aristocratic aloofness, penetrating intellect, and poetic sensibility
made him the foremost leader of the educated Bengālis. These addressed
him by the respectful epithet of <em>Maharshi,</em> the \"Great Seer\". The
Maharshi was a Sanskrit scholar and, unlike Rājā Rāmmohan Roy, drew his
inspiration entirely from the Upanishads. He was an implacable enemy of
image worship and also fought to stop the</p>
<p>infiltration of Christian ideas into the Samāj. He gave the movement its
faith and ritual. Under his influence the Brāhmo Samāj professed One
Self-existent Supreme Being who had created the universe out of nothing,
the God of Truth, Infinite Wisdom, Goodness, and Power, the Eternal and
Omnipotent, the One without a Second. Man should love Him and do His
will, believe in Him and worship Him, and thus merit salvation in the
world to come.</p>
<p>By far the ablest leader of the Brāhmo movement was Keshab Chandra Sen
(1838-1884). Unlike Rājā Rāmmohan Roy and Devendranāth Tāgore, Keshab
was born of a middle-class Bengāli family and had been brought up in an
English school. He did not know Sanskrit and very soon broke away from
the popular Hindu religion. Even at an early age he came under the spell
of Christ and professed to have experienced the special favour of John
the Baptist, Christ, and St. Paul. When he strove to introduce Christ to
the Brāhmo Samāj, a rupture became inevitable with Devendranāth. In 1868
Keshab broke with the older leader and founded the Brāhmo Samāj of
India, Devendra retaining leadership of the first Brāhmo Samāj, now
called the Ādi Samāj.</p>
<p>Keshab possessed a complex nature. When passing through a great moral
crisis, he spent much of his time in solitude and felt that he heard the
voice of God. When a devotional form of worship was introduced into the
Brāhmo Samāj, he spent hours in singing kirtan with his followers. He
visited England in 1870 and impressed the English people with his
musical voice, his simple English, and his spiritual fervour. He was
entertained by Queen Victoria. Returning to India, he founded centres of
the Brāhmo Samāj in various parts of the country. Not unlike a professor
of comparative religion in a European university, he began to discover,
about the time of his first contact with Sri Ramakrishna, the harmony of
religions. He became sympathetic toward the Hindu gods and goddesses,
explaining them in a liberal fashion. Further, he believed that he was
called by God to dictate to the world God\'s newly revealed law, the New
Dispensation, the <strong>Nava-vidhān.</strong></p>
<p>In 1878 a schism divided Keshab\'s Samāj. Some of his influential
followers accused him of infringing the Brāhmo principles by marrying
his daughter to a wealthy man before she had attained the marriageable
age approved by the Samāj. This group seceded and established the
Sādhāran Brāhmo Samāj, Keshab remaining the leader of the Navavidhān.
Keshab now began to be drawn more and more toward the Christ ideal,
though under the influence of Sri Ramakrishna his devotion to the Divine
Mother also deepened. His mental oscillation between Christ and the
Divine Mother of Hinduism found no position of rest. In Bengāl and some
other parts of India the Brāhmo movement took the form of Unitarian
Christianity, scoffed at Hindu rituals, and preached a crusade against
image worship. Influenced by Western culture, it declared the supremacy
of reason, advocated the ideals of the French Revolution, abolished the
caste-system among, its own members, stood for the emancipation of
women, agitate for the abolition of early marriage, sanctioned the
remarriage of widows, and encouraged various educational and
social-reform movements. The immediate effect of the Brāhmo movement in
Bengāl was the checking of the proselytising activities of the Christian
missionaries. It also raised Indian culture in the estimation of its
English masters. But it was an intellectual and eclectic religious
ferment born of the necessity of the time. Unlike Hinduism, it was not
founded on the deep inner experiences of sages and prophets. Its
influence was confined to a comparatively few educated men and women of
the country, and the vast masses of the Hindus remained outside it. It
sounded monotonously only one of the notes in the rich gamut of the
Eternal Religion of the Hindus.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>rya Samāj</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The other movement playing an important part in the nineteenth-century
religious revival of India was the Ārya Samāj. The Brāhmo Samāj,
essentially a movement of compromise with European culture, tacitly
admitted the superiority of the West. But the founder of the Ārya Samāj
was a pugnacious Hindu sannyāsi who accepted the challenge of Islam and
Christianity and was resolved to combat all foreign influence in India.
Swāmi Dayānanda (1824-1883) launched this movement in Bombay in 1875,
and soon its influence was felt throughout western India. The Swāmi was
a great scholar of the Vedas, which he explained as being strictly
mono-theistic. He preached against the worship of images and
re-established the ancient Vedic sacrificial rites. According to him the
Vedas were the ultimate authority on religion, and he accepted every
word of them as literally true. The Ārya Samāj became a bulwark against
the encroachments of Islam and Christianity, and its orthodox flavour
appealed to many Hindu minds. It also assumed leadership in many
movements of social</p>
<p>reform. The caste-system became a target of its attack. Women it
liberated from many of their social disabilities. The cause of education
received from it a great impetus. It started agitation against early
marriage and advocated the remarriage of Hindu widows. Its influence was
strongest in the Punjab, the battle-ground of the Hindu and Islamic
cultures. A new fighting attitude was introduced into the slumbering
Hindu society. Unlike the Brāhmo Samāj, the influence of the Ārya Samāj
was not confined to the intellectuals. It was a force that spread to the
masses. It was a dogmatic movement intolerant of those disagreed with
its views, and it emphasized only one way, the Ārya Samāj way, to the
realization of Truth. Sri Ramakrishna met Swāmi Dayānanda when the
latter visited Bengāl.</p>
<p><strong>Keshab Chandra Sen</strong></p>
<p>Keshab Chandra Sen and Sri Ramakrishna met for the first time in the
garden house of Jaygopāl Sen at Belgharia, a few miles from
Dakshineśwar, where the great Brāhmo leader was staying with some of his
disciples. In many respects the two were poles apart, though an
irresistible inner attraction was to make them intimate friends. The
Master had realized God as Pure Spirit and Consciousness, but he
believed in the various forms of God as well. Keshab, on the other hand,
regarded image worship as idolatry and gave allegorical explanations of
the Hindu deities. Keshab was an orator and a writer of books and
magazine articles; Sri Ramakrishna had a horror of lecturing and hardly
knew how to write his own name. Keshab\'s fame spread far and wide, even
reaching the distant shores of England; the Master still led a secluded
life in the village of Dakshineśwar. Keshab emphasized social reforms
for India\'s regeneration; to Sri Ramakrishna God-realization was the
only goal of life. Keshab considered himself a disciple of Christ and
accepted in a diluted form the Christian sacraments and Trinity; Sri
Ramakrishna was the simple child of Kāli, the Divine Mother, though he
too, in a different way, acknowledged Christ\'s divinity. Keshab was a
house-holder and took a real interest in the welfare of his children,
whereas Sri Ramakrishna was a paramahamsa and completely indifferent to
the life of the world. Yet, as their acquaintance ripened into
friendship, Sri Ramakrishna and Keshab held each other in great love and
respect. Years later, at the news of Keshab\'s death, the Master felt as
if half his body had become paralysed. Keshab\'s concepts of the harmony
of religions and the Motherhood of God were deepened and enriched by his
contact with Sri Ramakrishna.</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna, dressed in a red-bordered dhoti, one end of which was
carelessly thrown over his left shoulder, came to Jaygopal\'s garden
house accompanied by Hriday. No one took notice of the unostentatious
visitor. Finally the Master said to Keshab, \"People tell me you have
seen God; so I have come to hear from you about God.\" A magnificent
conversation followed. The Master sang a thrilling song about Kāli and
forthwith went into Samādhi. When Hriday uttered the sacred \"Om\" in
his ears, he gradually came back to consciousness of the world, his face
still radiating a divine brilliance. Keshab and his followers were
amazed. The contrast between Sri Ramakrishna and the Brāhmo devotees was
very interesting. There sat this small man, thin and extremely delicate.
His eyes were illumined with an inner light. Good humour gleamed in his
eyes and lurked in the corners of his mouth. His speech was Bengāli of a
homely kind with a slight, delightful stammer, and his words held men
enthralled by their wealth of spiritual experience, their inexhaustible
store of simile and metaphor, their power of observation, their bright
and subtle humour, their wonderful catholicity, their ceaseless flow of
wisdom. And around him now were the sophisticated men of Bengāl, the
best products of Western education, with Keshab, the idol of young
Bengāl, as their leader.</p>
<p>Keshab\'s sincerity was enough for Sri Ramakrishna. Henceforth the two
saw each other frequently, either at Dakshineśwar or at the temple of
the Brāhmo Samāj. Whenever the Master was in the temple at the time of
divine service, Keshab would request him to speak to the congregation.
And Keshab would visit the saint, in his turn, with offerings of flowers
and fruits.</p>
<p><strong>Other Brāhmo Leaders</strong></p>
<p>Gradually other Brāhmo leaders began to feel Sri Ramakrishna\'s
influence. But they were by no means uncritical admirers of the Master.
They particularly disapproved of his ascetic renunciation and
condemnation of, \"woman and gold\".7 They measured him according to
their own ideals of the householder\'s life. Some could not understand
his Samādhi and described it as a nervous malady. Yet they could not
resist his magnetic</p>
<p>personality.</p>
<p>Among the Brāhmo leaders who knew the Master closely were Pratāp Chandra
Mazumdār, Vijay Krishna Goswāmi, Trailokyanāth Sannyāl and Śivanāth
Śastri.</p>
<p>Śivanāth, one day, was greatly impressed by the Master\'s utter
simplicity and abhorrence of praise. He was seated with Sri Ramakrishna
in the latter\'s room when several rich men of Calcutta arrived. The
Master left the room for a few minutes. In the mean time Hriday, his
nephew, began to describe his Samādhi to the visitors. The last few
words caught the Master\'s ear as he entered the room. He said to
Hriday: \"What a mean-spirited fellow you must be to extol me thus
before these rich men! You have seen their costly apparel and their gold
watches and chains, and your object is to get from them as much money as
you can. What do I care about what they think of me? (Turning to the
gentlemen) No, my friends, what he has told you about me is not true. It
was not love of God that made me absorbed in God and indifferent to
external life. I became positively insane for some time. The <em>sādhus</em>
who frequented this temple told me to practise many things. I tried to
follow them, and the consequence was that my austerities drove me to
insanity.\" This is a quotation from one of Śivanāth\'s books. He took
the Master\'s words literally and failed to see their real import.</p>
<p>Śivanāth vehemently criticized the Master for his other-worldly attitude
toward his wife. He writes: \"Ramakrishna was practically separated from
his wife, who lived in her village home. One day when I was complaining
to some friends about the virtual widowhood of his wife, he drew me to
one side and whispered in my ear: \'Why do you complain? It is no longer
possible; it is all dead and gone.\' Another day as I was inveighing
against this part of his teaching, and also declaring that our program
of work in the Brāhmo Samāj includes women, that ours is a social and
domestic religion, and that we want to give education and social liberty
to women, the saint became very much excited, as was his way when
anything against his settled conviction was asserted - a trait we so
much liked in him - and exclaimed, \'Go, thou fool, go and perish in the
pit that your women will dig for you.\' Then he glared at me and said:
\'What does a gardener do with a young plant? Does he not surround it
with a fence, to protect it from goats and cattle? And when the young
plant has grown up into a tree and it can no longer be injured by
cattle, does he not remove the fence and let the tree grow freely?\' I
replied, \'Yes, that is the custom with gardeners.\' Then he remarked,
\'Do the same in your spiritual life; become strong, be full-grown; then
you may seek them.\' To which I replied, \'I don\'t agree with you in
thinking that women\'s work is like that of cattle, destructive; they
are our associates and helpers in our spiritual struggles and social
progress\' - a view with which he could not agree, and he marked his
dissent by shaking his head. Then referring to the lateness of the hour
he jocularly remarked, \'It is time for you to depart; take care, do not
be late; otherwise your woman will not admit you into her room.\' This
evoked hearty laughter.\"</p>
<p>Pratāp Chandra Mazumdār, the right-hand man of Keshab and an
accomplished Brāhmo preacher in Europe and America, bitterly criticized
Sri Ramakrishna\'s use of uncultured language and also his austere
attitude toward his wife. But he could not escape the spell of the
Master\'s personality. In the course of an article about Sri
Ramakrishna, Pratāp wrote in the \"Theistic Quarterly Review\": \"What
is there in common between him and me? I, a Europeanized, civilized,
self-centered, semi-sceptical, so-called educated reasoner, and he, a
poor, illiterate, unpolished, half-idolatrous, friendless Hindu devotee?
Why should I sit long hours to attend to him, I, who have listened to
Disraeli and Fawcett, Stanley and Max Muller, and a whole host of
European scholars and divines? ... And it is not I only, but dozens like
me, who do the same. ... He worships Śiva, he worships Kāli, he worships
Rāmā, he worships Krishna, and is a confirmed advocate of Vedāntic
doctrines. ... He is an idolater, yet is a faithful and most devoted
Meditator on the perfections of the One Formless, Absolute, Infinite
Deity. ... His religion is ecstasy, his worship means transcendental
insight, his whole nature burns day and night with a permanent fire and
fever of a strange faith and feeling. ... So long as he is spared to us,
gladly shall we sit at his feet to learn from him the sublime precepts
of purity, unworldliness, spirituality, and inebriation in the love of
God. ... He, by his childlike bhakti, by his strong conceptions of an
ever-ready Motherhood, helped to unfold it [God as our Mother] in our
minds wonderfully. ... By associating with him we learnt to realize
better the divine attributes as scattered over the three hundred and
thirty millions of deities of mythological India, the</p>
<p>gods of the Purānās.\"</p>
<p>The Brāhmo leaders received much inspiration from their contact with Sri
Ramakrishna. It broadened their religious views and kindled in their
hearts the yearning for God-realization; it made them understand and
appreciate the rituals and symbols of Hindu religion, convinced them of
the manifestation of God in diverse forms, and deepened their thoughts
about the harmony of religions. The Master, too, was impressed by the
sincerity of many of the, Brāhmo devotees. He told them about his own
realizations and explained to them the essence of his teachings, such as
the necessity of renunciation, sincerity in the pursuit of one\'s own
course of discipline, faith in God, the performance of one\'s duties
without thought of results, and discrimination between the Real and the
unreal.</p>
<p>This contact with the educated and progressive Bengālis opened Sri
Ramakrishna\'s eyes to a new realm of thought. Born and brought up in a
simple village, without any formal education, and taught by the orthodox
holy men of India in religious life, he had had no opportunity to study
the influence of modernism on the thoughts and lives of the Hindus. He
could not properly estimate the result of the impact of Western
education on Indian culture. He was a Hindu of the Hindus, renunciation
being to him the only means to the realization of God in life. From the
Brahmos he learnt that the new generation of India made a compromise
between God and the world. Educated young men were influenced more by
the Western philosophers than by their own prophets. But Sri Ramakrishna
was not dismayed, for he saw in this, too, the hand of God. And though
he expounded to the Brahmos all his ideas about God and austere
religious disciplines, yet he bade them accept from his teachings only
as much as suited their tastes and temperaments.</p>
<p><strong>The Master\'s Yearning for His Own Devotees</strong></p>
<p>Contact with the Brahmos increased Sri Ramakrishna\'s longing to
encounter aspirants who would be able to follow his teachings in their
purest form. \"There was no limit\", he once declared, \"to the longing
I felt at that time. During the day-time I somehow managed to control
it. The secular talk of the worldly-minded was galling to me, and I
would look wistfully to the day when my own beloved companions would
come. I hoped to find solace in conversing with them and relating to
them my own realizations. Every little incident would remind me of them,
and thoughts of them wholly engrossed me. I was already arranging in my
mind what I should say to one and give to another, and so on. But when
the day would come to a close I would not be able to curb my feelings.
The thought that another day had gone by, and they had not come,
oppressed me. When, during the evening service, the temples rang with
the sound of bells and conch-shells, I would climb to the roof of the
<em>Kuthi</em> in the garden and, writhing in anguish of heart, cry at the top
of my voice: \'Come, my children! Oh, where are you? I cannot bear to
live without you.\' A mother never longed so intensely for the sight of
her child, nor a friend for his companions, nor a lover for his
sweetheart, as I longed for them. Oh, it was indescribable! Shortly
after this period of yearning the devotees began to come.\"</p>
<p>In the year 1879 occasional writings about Sri Ramakrishna by the
Brahmos, in the Brāhmo magazines, began to attract his future disciples
from the educated middle-class Bengālis, and they continued to come till
1884. But others, too, came, feeling the subtle power of his attraction.
They were an ever shifting crowd of people of all castes and creeds:
Hindus and Brahmos, Vaishnavas and Śāktās, the educated with university
degrees and the illiterate, old and young, maharajas and beggars,
journalists and artists, pundits and devotees, philosophers and the
worldly-minded, jnānis and yogis, men of action and men of faith,
virtuous women and prostitutes, office-holders and vagabonds,
philanthropists and self-seekers, dramatists and drunkards, builders-up
and pullers-down. He gave to them all, without stint, from his
illimitable store of realization. No one went away empty-handed. He
taught them the lofty knowledge of the Vedānta and the soul-melting love
of the Purānā. Twenty hours out of twenty-four he would speak without
rest or respite. He gave to all his sympathy and enlightenment, and he
touched them with that strange power of the soul which could not but
melt even the most hardened. And people understood him according to
their powers of comprehension.</p>
<p><strong>The Master\'s Method of Teaching</strong></p>
<p>But he remained as ever the willing instrument in the hand of God, the
child of the Divine Mother, totally untouched by the idea of being a
teacher. He used to say that three ideas - that he was a guru, a father,
and</p>
<p>a master - pricked his flesh like thorns. Yet he was an extraordinary
teacher. He stirred his disciples\' hearts more by a subtle influence
than by actions or words. He never claimed to be the founder of a
religion or the organizer of a sect. Yet he was a religious dynamo. He
was the verifier of all religions and creeds. He was like an expert
gardener, who prepares the soil and removes the weeds, knowing that the
plants will grow because of the inherent power of the seeds, producing
each its appropriate flowers and fruits. He never thrust his ideas on
anybody. He understood people\'s limitations and worked on the principle
that what is good for one may be bad for another. He had the unusual
power of knowing the devotees\' minds, even their inmost souls, at the
first sight. He accepted disciples with the full knowledge of their past
tendencies and future possibilities. The life of evil did not frighten
him, nor did religious squeamishness raise anybody in his estimation. He
saw in everything the unerring finger of the Divine Mother. Even the
light that leads astray was to him the light from God.</p>
<p>To those who became his intimate disciples the Master was a friend,
companion, and playmate. Even the chores of religious discipline would
be lightened in his presence. The devotees would be so inebriated with
pure joy in his company that they would have no time to ask themselves
whether he was an Incarnation, a perfect soul, or a yogi. His very
presence was a great teaching; words were superfluous. In later years
his disciples remarked that while they were with him they would regard
him as a comrade, but afterwards would tremble to think of their
frivolities in the presence of such a great person. They had convincing
proof that the Master could, by his mere wish, kindle in their hearts
the love of God and give them His vision.</p>
<p>Through all this fun and frolic, this merriment and frivolity, he always
kept before them the shining ideal of God-Consciousness and the path of
renunciation. He prescribed ascents steep or graded according to the
powers of the climber. He permitted no compromise with the basic
principles of purity. An aspirant had to keep his body, mind, senses,
and soul unspotted; had to have a sincere love for God and an ever
mounting spirit of yearning. The rest would be done by the Mother.</p>
<p>His disciples were of two kinds: the householders, and the young men,
some of whom were later to become monks. There was also a small group of
women devotees.</p>
<p><strong>House Holder Devotees</strong></p>
<p>For the householders Sri Ramakrishna did not prescribe the hard path of
total renunciation. He wanted them to discharge their obligations to
their families. Their renunciation was to be mental. Spiritual life
could not he acquired by flying away from responsibilities. A married
couple should live like brother and sister after the birth of one or two
children, devoting their time to spiritual talk and contemplation. He
encouraged the householders, saying that their life was, in a way,
easier than that of the monk, since it was more advantageous to fight
the enemy from inside a fortress than in an open field. He insisted,
however, on their repairing into solitude every now and then to
strengthen their devotion and faith in God through prayer, japa, and
meditation. He prescribed for them the companionship of <em>sādhus</em>. He
asked them to perform their worldly duties with one hand, while holding
to God with the other, and to pray to God to make their duties fewer and
fewer so that in the end they might cling to Him with both hands. He
would discourage in both the householders and the celibate youths any
lukewarmness in their spiritual struggles. He would not ask them to
follow indiscriminately the ideal of non-resistance, which ultimately
makes a coward of the unwary.</p>
<p><strong>Future Monks</strong></p>
<p>But to the young men destined to be monks he pointed out the steep path
of renunciation, both external and internal. They must take the vow of
absolute continence and eschew all thought of greed and lust. By the
practice of continence, aspirants develop a subtle nerve through which
they understand the deeper mysteries of God. For them self-control is
final, imperative, and absolute. The sannyāsis are teachers of men, and
their lives should be totally free from blemish. They must not even look
at a picture which may awaken their animal passions. The Master selected
his future monks from young men untouched by \"woman and gold\" and
plastic enough to be cast in his spiritual mould. When teaching them the
path of renunciation and discrimination, he would not allow the
householders to be any where near them.</p>
<p><strong>Rām and Manomohan</strong></p>
<p>The first two householder devotees to come to Dakshineśwar were Rām
Chandra Dutta and Manomohan Mitra. A medical practitioner and chemist,
Rām was sceptical about God and religion and never enjoyed peace of
soul. He wanted tangible proof of God\'s existence. The Master said to
him: \"God really exists. You don\'t see the stars in the day-time, but
that doesn\'t mean that the stars do not exist. There is butter in milk.
But can anybody see it by merely looking at the milk? To get butter you
must churn milk in a quiet and cool place. You cannot realize God by a
mere wish; you must go through some mental disciplines.\" By degrees the
Master awakened Rām\'s spirituality and the latter became one of his
foremost lay disciples. It was Rām who introduced Narendranāth to Sri
Ramakrishna. Narendra was a relative of Rām.</p>
<p>Manomohan at first met with considerable opposition from his wife and
other relatives, who resented his visits to Dakshineśwar. But in the end
the unselfish love of the Master triumphed over worldly affection. It
was Manomohan who brought Rākhāl to the Master.</p>
<p><strong>Surendra</strong></p>
<p>Suresh Mitra, a beloved disciple whom the Master often addressed as
Surendra, had received an English education and held an important post
in an English firm. Like many other educated young men of the time, he
prided himself on his atheism and led a Bohemian life. He was addicted
to drinking. He cherished an exaggerated notion about man\'s free will.
A victim of mental depression, he was brought to Sri Ramakrishna by
Rāmchandra Dutta. When he heard the Master asking a disciple to practise
the virtue of self-surrender to God, he was impressed. But though he
tried thenceforth to do so, he was unable to give up his old associates
and his drinking. One day the Master said in his presence, \"Well, when
a man goes to an undesirable place, why doesn\'t he take the Divine
Mother with him?\" And to Surendra himself Sri Ramakrishna said: \"Why
should you drink wine as wine? Offer it to Kāli, and then take it as Her
<em>Prasād,</em> as consecrated drink. But see that you don\'t, become
intoxicated; you must not reel and your thoughts must not wander. At
first you will feel ordinary excitement, but soon you will experience
spiritual exaltation.\" Gradually Surendra\'s entire life was changed.
The Master designated him as one of those commissioned by the Divine
Mother to defray a great part of his expenses. Surendra\'s purse was
always open for the Master\'s comfort.</p>
<p><strong>Kedār</strong></p>
<p>Kedarnāth Chatterji was endowed with a spiritual temperament and had
tried various paths of religion, some not very commendable. When he met
the Master at Dakshineśwar he understood the true meaning of religion.
It is said that the Master, weary of instructing devotees who were
coming to him in great numbers for guidance, once prayed to the Goddess
Kāli: \"Mother, I am tired of speaking to people. Please give power to
Kedār, Girish, Rām, Vijay, and Mahendra to give them the preliminary
instruction, so that just a little teaching from me will be enough.\" He
was aware, however, of Kedār\'s lingering attachment to worldly things
and often warned him about it.</p>
<p><strong>Harish</strong></p>
<p>Harish, a young man in affluent circumstances, renounced his family and
took shelter with the Master, who loved him for his sincerity,
singleness of purpose, and quiet nature. He spent his leisure time in
prayer and meditation, turning a deaf ear to the entreaties and threats
of his relatives. Referring to his undisturbed peace of mind, the Master
would say: \"Real men are dead to the world though, living. Look at
Harish. He is an example.\" When one day the Master asked him to be a
little kind to his wife, Harish said: \"You must excuse me on this
point. This is not the place to show kindness. If I try to be
sympathetic to her, there is a possibility of my forgetting the ideal
and becoming entangled in the world.\"</p>
<p><strong>Bhavanāth</strong></p>
<p>Bhavanāth Chatterji visited the Master while he was still in his teens.
His parents and relatives regarded Sri Ramakrishna as an insane person
and tried their utmost to prevent him from becoming intimate with the
Master. But the young boy was very stubborn and often spent nights at
Dakshineśwar. He was greatly attached</p>
<p><em>sādhus</em></p>
<p>to Narendra, and the Master encouraged their friendship. The very sight
of him often awakened Sri Ramakrishna\'s spiritual emotion.</p>
<p><strong>Balarām Bose</strong></p>
<p>Balarām Bose came of a wealthy Vaishnava family. From his youth he had
shown a deep religious temperament and had devoted his time to
meditation, prayer, and the study of the Vaishnava scriptures. He was
very much impressed by Sri Ramakrishna even at their first meeting. He
asked Sri Ramakrishna whether God really existed and, if so, whether a
man could realize Him. The Master said: \"God reveals Himself to the
devotee who thinks of Him as his nearest and dearest. Because you do not
draw response by praying to Him once, you must not conclude that He does
not exist. Pray to God, thinking of Him as dearer than your very self.
He is much attached to His devotees. He comes to a man even before He is
sought. There is none more intimate and affectionate than God.\" Balarām
had never before heard God spoken of in such forceful words; every one
of the words seemed true to him. Under the Master\'s influence he
outgrew the conventions of the Vaishnava worship and became one of the
most beloved of the disciples. It was at his home that the Master slept
whenever he spent a night in Calcutta.</p>
<p><strong>Mahendra or M.</strong></p>
<p>Mahendranāth Gupta, known as \"M.\", arrived at Dakshineśwar in February
1882. He belonged to the Brāhmo Samāj and was headmaster of the
Vidyāsāgar High School at Śyāmbazār, Calcutta. At the very first sight
the Master recognized him as one of his \"marked\" disciples. Mahendra
recorded in his diary Sri Ramakrishna\'s conversations with his
devotees. These are the first directly recorded words, in the spiritual
history of the world, of a man recognized as belonging in the class of
Buddha and Christ. The present volume is a translation of this diary.
Mahendra was instrumental, through his personal contacts, in spreading
the Master\'s message among many young and aspiring souls.</p>
<p><strong>Nāg Mahāshay</strong></p>
<p>Durgācharan Nāg, also known as Nāg Mahāshay, was the ideal householder
among the lay disciples of Sri Ramakrishna. He was the embodiment of the
Master\'s ideal of life in the world, unstained by worldliness. In spite
of his intense desire to become a sannyāsi, Sri Ramakrishna asked him to
live in the world in the spirit of a monk, and the disciple truly
carried out this injunction. He was born of a poor family and even
during his boyhood often sacrificed everything to lessen the sufferings
of the needy. He had married at an early age and after his wife\'s death
had married a second time to obey his father\'s command. But he once
said to his wife: \"Love on the physical level never lasts. He is indeed
blessed who can give his love to God with his whole heart. Even a little
attachment to the body endures for several births. So do not be attached
to this cage of bone and flesh. Take shelter at the feet of the Mother
and think of Her alone. Thus your life here and hereafter will he
ennobled.\" The Master spoke of him as a \"blazing light\". He received
every word of Sri Ramakrishna in dead earnest. One day he heard the
Master saying that it was difficult for doctors, lawyers, and brokers to
make much progress in spirituality. Of doctors he said, \"If the mind
clings to the tiny drops of medicine, how can it conceive of the
Infinite?\" That was the end of Durgācharan\'s medical practice and he
threw his chest of medicines into the Ganges. Sri Ramakrishna assured
him that he would not lack simple food and clothing. He</p>
<p>bade him serve holy men. On being asked where he would find real holy
men, the Master said that the themselves would seek his company. No
sannyāsi could have lived a more austere life than Durgācharan.</p>
<p><strong>Girish Ghosh</strong></p>
<p>Girish Chandra Ghosh was a born rebel against God, a sceptic, a
Bohemian, a drunkard. He was the greatest Bengāli dramatist of his time,
the father of the modern Bengāli stage. Like other young men he had
imbibed all the vices of the West. He had plunged into a life of
dissipation and had become convinced that religion was only a fraud.
Materialistic philosophy he justified as enabling one to get at least a
little fun out of life. But a series of reverses shocked him and he
became eager to solve the riddle of life. He had heard people say that
in spiritual life the help of a guru was imperative and that the guru
was to be regarded as God Himself. But Girish was too well acquainted
with human nature to see perfection in a man. His first meeting with Sri
Ramakrishna did not impress him at all. He returned home feeling as if
he had seen a freak at a circus; for the</p>
<p>Master, in a semi-conscious mood, had inquired whether it was evening,
though the lamps were burning in the room. But their paths often
crossed, and Girish could not avoid further encounters. The Master
attended a performance in Girish\'s Star Theatre. On this occasion, too,
Girish found nothing impressive about him. One day, however, Girish
happened to see the Master dancing and singing with the devotees. He
felt the contagion and wanted to join them, but restrained himself for
fear of ridicule. Another day Sri Ramakrishna was about to give him
spiritual instruction, when Girish said: \"I don\'t want to listen to
instructions. I have myself written many instructions. They are of no
use to me. Please help me in a more tangible way if you can.\" This
pleased the Master and he asked Girish to cultivate faith.</p>
<p>As time passed, Girish began to learn that the guru is the one who
silently unfolds the disciple\'s inner life. He became a steadfast
devotee of the Master.</p>
<p>He often loaded the Master with insults, drank in his presence, and took
liberties which astounded the other devotees. But the Master knew that
at heart Girish was tender, faithful, and sincere. He would not allow
Girish to give up the theatre. And when a devotee asked him to tell
Girish to give up drinking, he sternly replied: \"That is none of your
business. He who has taken charge of him will look after him. Girish is
a devotee of heroic type. I tell you, drinking will not affect him.\"
The Master knew that mere words could not induce a man to break
deep-rooted habits, but that the silent influence of love worked
miracles. Therefore he never asked him to give up alcohol, with the
result that Girish himself eventually broke the habit. Sri Ramakrishna
had strengthened Girish\'s resolution by allowing him to feel that he
was absolutely free.</p>
<p>One day Girish felt depressed because he was unable to submit to any
routine of spiritual discipline. In an exalted mood the Master said to
him: \"All right, give me your power of attorney. Henceforth I assume
responsibility for you. You need not do anything.\" Girish heaved a sigh
of relief. He felt happy to think that Sri Ramakrishna had assumed his
spiritual responsibilities. But poor Girish could not then realize that
he also, on his part, had to give up his freedom and make of himself a
puppet in Sri Ramakrishna\'s hands. The Master began to discipline him
according to this new attitude. One day Girish said about a trifling
matter, \"Yes, I shall do this.\" \"No, no!\" the Master corrected him.
\"You must not speak in that egotistic manner. You should say, \'God
willing, I shall do it\'.\" Girish understood. Thenceforth he tried to
give up all idea of personal responsibility and surrender himself to the
Divine Will. His mind began to dwell constantly on Sri Ramakrishna. This
unconscious meditation in time chastened his turbulent spirit.</p>
<p>The householder devotees generally visited Sri Ramakrishna on Sunday
afternoons and other holidays. Thus a brotherhood was gradually formed,
and the Master encouraged their fraternal feeling. Now and then he would
accept an invitation to a devotee\'s home, where other devotees would
also be invited. Kirtan would be arranged and they would spend hours in
dance and devotional music. The Master would go into trances or open his
heart in religious discourses and in the narration of his own spiritual
experiences. Many people who could not go to Dakshineśwar participated
in these meetings and felt blessed. Such an occasion would be concluded
with a sumptuous feast.</p>
<p>But it was in the company of his younger devotees, pure souls yet
unstained by the touch of worldliness, that Sri Ramakrishna took
greatest joy. Among the young men who later embraced the householder\'s
life were Nārāyan, Paltu, the younger Naren, Tejchandra and Purna. These
visited the Master sometimes against strong opposition from home.</p>
<p><strong>Purna</strong></p>
<p>Purna was a lad of thirteen, whom Sri Ramakrishna described as an
<em>Iśvarakoti,</em> a soul born with special spiritual qualities. The Master
said that Purna was the last of the group of brilliant devotees who, as
he once had seen in a trance, would come to him for spiritual
illumination. Purna said to Sri Ramakrishna during their second meeting,
\"You are God Himself incarnated in flesh and blood.\" Such words coming
from a mere youngster proved of what stuff the boy was made.</p>
<p><strong>Mahimācharan and Pratāp Hazra</strong></p>
<p>Mahimācharan and Pratāp Hazra were two devotees outstanding for their
pretentiousness and idiosyncrasies. But the Master showed them his
unfailing love and kindness, though he was aware of their shortcomings.
Mahimācharan Chakravarty had met the Master long before the arrival of
the other disciples. He had had the intention of leading a spiritual
life, but a strong desire to acquire name and fame was his weakness. He
claimed to have been initiated by Totāpuri and used to say that he had
been following the path of knowledge according to his guru\'s
instructions. He possessed a large library of English and Sanskrit
books. But though he pretended to have read them, most of the leaves
were uncut. The Master knew all his limitations, yet enjoyed listening
to him recite from the Vedas and other scriptures. He would always
exhort Mahimā to meditate on the meaning of the scriptural texts and to
practise spiritual discipline.</p>
<p>Pratāp Hazra, a middle-aged man, hailed from a village near Kāmārpukur.
He was not altogether unresponsive to religious feelings. On a moment\'s
impulse he had left his home, aged mother, wife, and children, and had
found shelter in the temple garden at Dakshineśwar, where he intended to
lead a spiritual life. He loved to argue, and the Master often pointed
him out as an example of barren argumentation. He was hypercritical of
others and cherished an exaggerated notion of his own spiritual
advancement. He was mischievous and often tried to upset the minds of
the Master\'s young disciples, criticizing them for their happy and
joyous life and asking them to devote their time to meditation. The
Master teasingly compared Hazra to Jatila and Kutila, the two women who
always created obstructions in Krishna\'s sport with the gopis, and said
that Hazra lived at Dakshineśwar to \"thicken the plot\" by adding
complications.</p>
<p><strong>Some noted Men</strong></p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna also became acquainted with a number of people whose
scholarship or wealth entitled them everywhere to respect. He had met, a
few years before, <strong>Devendranāth Tāgore,</strong> famous all over Bengāl for
his wealth, scholarship, saintly character, and social position. But the
Master found him disappointing; for, whereas Sri Ramakrishna expected of
a saint complete renunciation of the world, Devendranāth combined with
his saintliness a life of enjoyment. Sri Ramakrishna met the great poet
<strong>Michael Madhusudan,</strong> who had embraced Christianity \"for the sake of
his stomach\". To him the Master could not impart instruction, for the
Divine Mother \"pressed his tongue\". In addition he met <strong>Mahārāja
Jatindra Mohan Tāgore,</strong> a titled aristocrat of Bengāl; <strong>Kristodās
Pāl,</strong> the editor, social reformer, and patriot; <strong>Iswar Chandra
Vidyāsāgar,</strong> the noted philanthropist and educator; <strong>Pundit
Śaśadhar,</strong> a great champion of Hindu orthodoxy; <strong>Aświni Kumār Dutta,</strong>
a headmaster, moralist, and leader of Indian Nationalism; and <strong>Bankim
Chatterji,</strong> a deputy magistrate, novelist, and essayist, and one of the
fashioners of modern Bengāli prose. Sri Ramakrishna was not the man to
be dazzled by outward show, glory, or eloquence. A pundit without
discrimination he regarded as a mere straw. He would search people\'s
hearts for the light of God, and if that was missing, he would have
nothing to do with them.</p>
<p><strong>Kristodās Pāl</strong></p>
<p>The Europeanized Kristodās Pāl did not approve of the Master\'s emphasis
on renunciation and said: \"Sir, this cant of renunciation has almost
ruined the country. It is for this reason that the Indians are a subject
nation today. Doing good to others, bringing education to the door of
the ignorant, and above all, improving the material conditions of the
country - these should be our duty now. The cry of religion and
renunciation would, on the contrary, only weaken us. You should advise
the young men of Bengāl to resort only to such acts as will uplift the
country.\" Sri Ramakrishna gave him a searching look and found no divine
light within. \"You man of poor understanding!\" Sri Ramakrishna said
sharply. \"You dare to slight in these terms renunciation and piety,
which our scriptures describe as the greatest of all virtues! After
reading two pages of English you think you have come to know the world!
You appear to think you are omniscient. Well, have you seen those tiny
crabs that are born in the Ganges just when the rains set in? In this
big universe you are even less significant than one of those small
creatures. How dare you talk of helping the world? The Lord will look to
that. You haven\'t the power in you to do it.\" After a pause the Master
continued: \"Can you explain to me how you can work for others? I know
what you mean by helping them. To feed a number of persons, to treat
them when they are sick, to construct a road or dig a well - Isn\'t that
all? These are good deeds, no doubt, but how trifling in comparison with
the vastness of the universe! How far can a man advance in this line?
How many</p>
<p>people can you save from famine? Malaria has ruined a whole province;
what could you do to stop its onslaught? God alone looks after the
world. Let a man first realize Him. Let a man get the authority from God
and be endowed with His power; then, and then alone, may he think of
doing good to others. A man should first be purged of all egotism. Then
alone will the Blissful Mother ask him to work for the world.\" Sri
Ramakrishna mistrusted philanthropy that presumed to pose as charity. He
warned people against it. He saw in most acts of philanthropy nothing
but egotism, vanity, a desire for glory, a barren excitement to kill the
boredom of life, or an attempt to soothe a guilty conscience. True
charity, he taught, is the result of love of God - service to man in a
spirit of worship.</p>
<p><strong>Monastic Disciples</strong></p>
<p>The disciples whom the Master trained for monastic life were the
following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Narendranāth Dutta (Swāmi Vivekānanda)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nitya Niranjan Sen (Swāmi Niranjanānanda)</p>
<p>Rākhāl Chandra Ghosh (Swāmi Brahmānanda)</p>
<p>Kāliprasād Chandra (Swāmi Abhedānanda)</p>
<p>Gopāl Chandra Ghosh (Swāmi Advaitānanda)</p>
<p>Harināth Chattopādhyāya (Swāmi Turiyānanda)</p>
<p>Bāburām Ghosh (Swāmi Premānanda)</p>
<p>Sāradā Prasanna (Swāmi Trigunātitānanda)</p>
<p>Tāraknāth Ghoshāl (Swāmi Shivānanda)</p>
<p>Gangādhar Ghatak (Swāmi Akhandānanda)</p>
<p>Jogindranāth Choudhury (Swāmi Yogānanda)</p>
<p>Subodh Ghosh (Swāmi Subodhānanda)</p>
<p>Śashibhushan Chakravarty (Swāmi Rāmakrishnānanda)</p>
<p>Śaratchandra Chakravarty (Swāmi Sāradānanda)</p>
<p>Hariprasanna Chatterji (Swāmi Vijnānānanda)</p>
<p>Lātu (Swāmi Adhhutānanda)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Lātu</strong></p>
<p>The first of these young men to come to the Master was Lātu. Born of
obscure parents, in Behar, he came to Calcutta in search of work and was
engaged by Rāmchandra Dutta as house-boy. Learning of the saintly Sri
Ramakrishna, he visited the Master at Dakshineśwar and was deeply
touched by his cordiality. When he was about to leave, the Master asked
him to take some money and return home in a boat or carriage. But Lātu
declared he had a few pennies and jingled the coins in his pocket. Sri
Ramakrishna later requested Rām to allow Lātu to stay with him
permanently. Under Sri Ramakrishna\'s guidance Lātu made great progress
in meditation and was blessed with ecstatic visions, but all the efforts
of the Master to give him a smattering of education failed. Lātu was
very fond of kirtan and other devotional songs but remained all his life
illiterate.</p>
<p><strong>Rākhāl</strong></p>
<p>Even before Rākhāl\'s coming to Dakshineśwar, the Master had had visions
of him as his spiritual son and as a playmate of Krishna at Vrindāvan.
Rākhāl was born of wealthy parents. During his childhood he developed
wonderful spiritual traits and used to play at worshipping gods and
goddesses. In his teens he was married to a sister of Manomohan Mitra,
from whom he first heard of the Master. His father objected to his
association with Sri Ramakrishna but afterwards was reassured to find
that many celebrated people were visitors at Dakshineśwar. The
relationship between the Master and this beloved disciple was that of
mother and child. Sri Ramakrishna allowed Rākhāl many liberties denied
to others. But he would not hesitate to chastise the boy for improper
actions. At one time Rākhāl felt a childlike jealousy because he found
that other boys were receiving the Master\'s affection. He soon got over
it and realized his guru as the Guru of the whole universe. The Master
was worried to hear of his marriage, but was relieved to find that his
wife was a spiritual soul who would not be a hindrance to his progress.</p>
<p><strong>The Elder Gopāl</strong></p>
<p>Gopāl Chandra Ghosh came to Dakshineśwar at a rather advanced age and
was called the elder Gopāl. He had lost his wife, and the Master
assuaged his grief. Soon he renounced the world and devoted himself
fully to meditation and prayer. Some years later Gopāl gave the Master
the ochre cloths with which the latter initiated several of his
disciples into monastic life.</p>
<p><strong>Narendra</strong></p>
<p>To spread his message to the four corners of the earth Sri Ramakrishna
needed a strong instrument. With his frail body and delicate limbs he
could not make great journeys across wide spaces. And such an instrument
was found in Narendranāth Dutta, his beloved Naren, later known to the
world as Swāmi Vivekānanda. Even before meeting Narendranāth, the Master
had seen him in a vision as a sage, immersed in the meditation of the
Absolute, who at Sri Ramakrishna\'s request had agreed to take human
birth to assist him in his work.</p>
<p>Narendra was born in Calcutta on January 12, 1863, of an aristocratic
<em>Kāyastha</em> family. His mother was steeped in the great Hindu epics, and
his father, a distinguished attorney of the Calcutta High Court, was an
agnostic about religion, a friend of the poor, and a mocker at social
conventions. Even in his boyhood and youth Narendra possessed great
physical courage and presence of mind, a vivid imagination, deep power
of thought, keen intelligence, an extraordinary memory, a love of truth,
a passion for purity, a spirit of independence, and a tender heart. An
expert musician, he also acquired proficiency in physics, astronomy,
mathematics, philosophy, history, and literature. He grew up into an
extremely handsome young man. Even as a child he practised meditation
and showed great power of concentration. Though free and passionate in
word and action, he took the vow of austere religious chastity and never
allowed the fire of purity to be extinguished by the slightest
defilement of body or soul.</p>
<p>As he read in college the rationalistic Western philosophers of the
nineteenth century, his boyhood faith in God and religion was unsettled.
He would not accept religion on mere faith; he wanted demonstration of
God. But very soon his passionate nature discovered that mere Universal
Reason was cold and bloodless. His emotional nature, dissatisfied with a
mere abstraction, required a concrete support to help him in the hours
of temptation. He wanted an external power, a guru, who by embodying
perfection in the flesh would still the commotion of his soul. Attracted
by the magnetic personality of Keshab, he joined the Brāhmo Samāj and
became a singer in its choir. But in the Samāj he did not find the guru
who could say that he had seen God.</p>
<p>In a state of mental conflict and torture of soul, Narendra came to Sri
Ramakrishna at Dakshineśwar. He was then eighteen years of age and had
been in college two years. He entered the Master\'s room accompanied by
some light-hearted friends. At Sri Ramakrishna\'s request he sang a few
songs, pouring his whole soul into them, and the Master went into
Samādhi. A few minutes later Sri Ramakrishna suddenly left his seat,
took Narendra by the hand, and led him to the screened verandah north of
his room. They were alone. Addressing Narendra most tenderly, as if he
were a friend of long acquaintance, the Master said: \"Ah! You have come
very late. Why have you been so unkind as to make me wait all these
days? My ears are tired of hearing the futile words of worldly men. Oh,
how I have longed to pour my spirit into the heart of someone fitted to
receive my message!\" He talked thus, sobbing all the time. Then,
standing before Narendra with folded hands, he addressed him as
<strong>Nārāyana</strong>, born on earth to remove the misery of humanity. Grasping
Narendra\'s hand, he asked him to come again, alone, and very soon.
Narendra was startled. \"What is this I have come to see?\" he said to
himself. \"He must be stark mad. Why, I am the son of Viswanāth Dutta.
How dare he speak this way to me?\"</p>
<p>When they returned to the room and Narendra heard the Master speaking to
others, he was surprised to find in his words an inner logic, a striking
sincerity, and a convincing proof of his spiritual nature. In answer to
Narendra\'s question, \"Sir, have you seen God?\" the Master said:
\"Yes, I have seen God. I have seen Him more tangibly than I see you. I
have talked to Him more intimately than I am talking to you.\"
Continuing, the Master said: \"But, my child, who wants to see God?
People shed jugs of tears for money, wife, and children. But if they
would weep for God for only one day they would surely see Him.\"
Narendra was amazed. These</p>
<p>words he could not doubt. This was the first time he had ever heard a
man saying that he had seen God. But he could not reconcile these words
of the Master with the scene that had taken place on the verandah only a
few minutes before. He concluded that Sri Ramakrishna was a monomaniac,
and returned home rather puzzled in mind.</p>
<p>During his second visit, about a month later, suddenly, at the touch of
the Master, Narendra felt overwhelmed and saw the walls of the room and
everything around him whirling and vanishing. \"What are you doing to
me?</p>
<ol>
<li>he cried in terror. \"I have my father and mother at home.\" He saw
    his own ego and the whole universe almost swallowed in a nameless
    void. With a laugh the Master easily restored him. Narendra thought
    he might have been hypnotized, but he could not understand how a
    monomaniac could cast a spell over the mind of a strong person like
    himself. He returned home more confused than ever, resolved to be
    henceforth on his guard before this strange man.</li>
</ol>
<p>But during his third visit Narendra fared no better. This time, at the
Master\'s touch, he lost consciousness entirely. While he was still in
that state, Sri Ramakrishna questioned him concerning his spiritual
antecedents and whereabouts, his mission in this world, and the duration
of his mortal life. The answers confirmed what the Master himself had
known and inferred. Among other things, he came to know that Narendra
was a sage who had already attained perfection, and that the day he
learnt his real nature he would give up his body in yoga, by an act of
will.</p>
<p>A few more meetings completely removed from Narendra\'s mind the last
traces of the notion that Sri Ramakrishna might be a monomaniac or wily
hypnotist. His integrity, purity, renunciation, and unselfishness were
beyond question. But Narendra could not accept a man, an imperfect
mortal, as his guru. As a member of the Brāhmo Samāj, he could not
believe that a human intermediary was necessary between man and God.
Moreover, he openly laughed at Sri Ramakrishna\'s visions as
hallucinations. Yet in the secret chamber of his heart he bore a great
love for the Master.</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna was grateful to the Divine Mother for sending him one
who doubted his own realizations. Often he asked Narendra to test him as
the money-changers test their coins. He laughed at Narendra\'s biting
criticism of his spiritual experiences and Samādhi. When at times
Narendra\'s sharp words distressed him, the Divine Mother Herself would
console him, saying: \"Why do you listen to him? In a few days he will
believe your every word.\" He could hardly bear Narendra\'s absences.
Often he would weep bitterly for the sight of him. Sometimes Narendra
would find the Master\'s love embarrassing; and one day he sharply
scolded him, warning him that such infatuation would soon draw him down
to the level of its object. The Master was distressed and prayed to the
Divine Mother. Then he said to Narendra: \"You rogue, I won\'t listen to
you any more. Mother says that I love you because I see God in you, and
the day I no longer see God in you I shall not be able to bear even the
sight of you.\"</p>
<p>The Master wanted to train Narendra in the teachings of the
non-dualistic Vedānta philosophy. But Narendra, because of his Brāhmo
upbringing, considered it wholly blasphemous to look on man as one with
his Creator. One day at the temple garden he laughingly said to a
friend: \"How silly! This jug is God! This cup is God! Whatever we see
is God! And we too are God! Nothing could be more absurd.\" Sri
Ramakrishna came out of his room and gently touched him. Spellbound, he
immediately perceived that everything in the world was indeed God. A new
universe opened around him. Returning home in a dazed state, he found
there too that the food, the plate, the eater himself, the people around
him, were all God. When he walked in the street, he saw that the cabs,
the horses, the streams of people, the buildings, were all Brahman. He
could hardly go about his day\'s business. His parents became anxious
about him and thought him ill. And when the intensity of the experience
abated a little, he saw the world as a dream. Walking in the public
square, he would strike his head against the iron railings to know
whether they were real. It took him a number of days to recover his
normal self. He had a foretaste of the great experiences yet to come and
realized that the words of the Vedānta were true.</p>
<p>At the beginning of 1884 Narendra\'s father suddenly died of
heart-failure, leaving the family in a state of</p>
<p>utmost poverty. There were six or seven mouths to feed at home.
Creditors were knocking at the door. Relatives who had accepted his
father\'s unstinted kindness now became enemies, some even bringing suit
to deprive Narendra of his ancestral home. Actually starving and
barefoot, Narendra searched for a job, but without success. He began to
doubt whether anywhere in the world there was such a thing as unselfish
sympathy. Two rich women made evil proposals to him and promised to put
an end to his distress; but he refused them with contempt.</p>
<p>Narendra began to talk of his doubt of the very existence of God. His
friends thought he had become an atheist and piously circulated gossip
adducing unmentionable motives for his unbelief. His moral character was
maligned. Even some of the Master\'s disciples partly believed the
gossip, and Narendra told these to their faces that only a coward
believed in God through fear of suffering or hell. But he was distressed
to think that Sri Ramakrishna, too, might believe these false reports.
His pride revolted. He said to himself: \"What does it matter? If a
man\'s good name rests on such slender foundations, I don\'t care.\" But
later on he was amazed to learn that the Master had never lost faith in
him. To a disciple who complained about Narendra\'s degradation, Sri
Ramakrishna replied: \"Hush, you fool! The Mother has told me it can
never be so. I won\'t look at you if you speak that way again.\"</p>
<p>The moment came when Narendra\'s distress reached its climax. He had
gone the whole day without food. As he was returning home in the evening
he could hardly lift his tired limbs. He sat down in front of a house in
sheer exhaustion, too weak even to think. His mind began to wander.
Then, suddenly, a divine power lifted the veil over his soul. He found
the solution of the problem of the coexistence of divine justice and
misery, the presence of suffering in the creation of a blissful
Providence. He felt bodily refreshed, his soul was bathed in peace, and
he slept serenely.</p>
<p>Narendra now realized that he had a spiritual mission to fulfil. He
resolved to renounce the world, as his grandfather had renounced it, and
he came to Sri Ramakrishna for his blessing. But even before he had
opened his mouth, the Master knew what was in his mind and wept bitterly
at the thought of separation. \"I know you cannot lead a worldly life,\"
he said, \"but for my sake live in the world as long as I live.\"</p>
<p>One day, soon after, Narendra requested Sri Ramakrishna to pray to the
Divine Mother to remove his poverty. Sri Ramakrishna bade him pray to
Her himself, for She would certainly listen to his prayer. Narendra
entered the shrine of Kāli. As he stood before the image of the Mother,
he beheld Her as a living Goddess, ready to give wisdom and liberation.
Unable to ask Her for petty worldly things, he prayed only for knowledge
and renunciation, love and liberation. The Master rebuked him for his
failure to ask the Divine Mother to remove his poverty and sent him back
to the temple. But Narendra, standing in Her presence, again forgot the
purpose of his coming. Thrice he went to the temple at the bidding of
the Master, and thrice he returned, having forgotten in Her presence why
he had come. He was wondering about it when it suddenly flashed in his
mind that this was all the work of Sri Ramakrishna; so now he asked the
Master himself to remove his poverty, and was assured that his family
would not lack simple food and clothing.</p>
<p>This was a very rich and significant experience for Narendra. It taught
him that Śakti, the Divine Power, cannot be ignored in the world and
that in the relative plane the need of worshipping a Personal God is
imperative. Sri Ramakrishna was overjoyed with the conversion. The next
day, sitting almost on Narendra\'s lap, he said to a devotee, pointing
first to himself, then to Narendra: \"I see I am this, and again that.
Really I feel no difference. A stick floating in the Ganges seems to
divide the water; but in reality the water is one. Do you see my point?
Well, whatever is, is the Mother - isn\'t that so?\" In later years
Narendra would say: \"Sri Ramakrishna was the only person who, from the
time he met me, believed in me uniformly throughout. Even my mother and
brothers did not. It was his unwavering trust and love for me that bound
me to him for ever. He alone knew how to love. Worldly people only make
a show of love for selfish ends.\"</p>
<p><strong>Tārak</strong></p>
<p>Others destined to be monastic disciples of Sri Ramakrishna came to
Dakshineśwar. Tāraknāth Ghoshāl had felt from his boyhood the noble
desire to realize God. Keshab and the Brāhmo Samāj had attracted him but</p>
<p>proved inadequate. In 1882 he first met the Master at Rāmchandra\'s
house and was astonished to hear him talk about Samādhi, a subject which
always fascinated his mind. And that evening he actually saw a
manifestation of that superconscious state in the Master. Tārak became a
frequent visitor at Dakshineśwar and received the Master\'s grace in
abundance. The young boy often felt ecstatic fervour in meditation. He
also wept profusely while meditating on God. Sri Ramakrishna said to
him: \"God favours those who can weep for Him. Tears shed for God wash
away the sins of former births.\"</p>
<p><strong>Bāburām</strong></p>
<p>Bāburām Ghosh came to Dakshineśwar accompanied by Rākhāl, his classmate.
The Master, as was often his custom, examined the boy\'s physiognomy and
was satisfied about his latent spirituality. At the age of eight Bāburām
had thought of leading a life of renunciation, in the company of a monk,
in a hut shut out from the public view by a thick wall of trees. The
very sight of the Panchavati awakened in his heart that dream of
boyhood. Bāburām was tender in body and soul. The Master used to say
that he was pure to his very bones. One day Hazra in his usual
mischievous fashion advised Bāburām and some of the other young boys to
ask Sri Ramakrishna for some spiritual powers and not waste their life
in mere gaiety and merriment. The Master, scenting mischief, called
Bāburām to his side, and said: \"What can you ask of me? Isn\'t
everything that I have already yours? Yes, everything I have earned in
the shape of realizations is for the sake of you all. So get rid of the
idea of begging, which alienates by creating a distance. Rather realize
your kinship with me and gain the key to all the treasures.\"</p>
<p><strong>Niranjan</strong></p>
<p>Nitya Niranjan Sen was a disciple of heroic type. He came to the Master
when he was eighteen years old. He was a medium for a group of
spiritualists. During his first visit the Master said to him: \"My boy,
if you think always of ghosts you will become a ghost, and if you think
of God you will become God. Now, which do you prefer?\" Niranjan severed
all connections with the spiritualists. During his second visit the
Master embraced him and said warmly: \"Niranjan, my boy, the days are
flitting away. When will you realize God? This life will be in vain if
you do not realize Him. When will You devote your mind wholly to God?\"
Niranjan was surprised to see the Master\'s great anxiety for his
spiritual welfare. He was a young man endowed with unusual spiritual
parts. He felt disdain for worldly pleasures and was totally guileless,
like a child. But he had a violent temper. One day, as he was coming in
a country boat to Dakshineśwar, some of his fellow passengers began to
speak ill of the Master. Finding his protest futile, Niranjan began to
rock the boat, threatening to sink it in midstream. That silenced the
offenders. When he reported the incident to the Master, he was rebuked
for his inability to curb his anger.</p>
<p><strong>Jogindra</strong></p>
<p>Jogindranāth, on the other hand, was gentle to a fault. One day, under
circumstances very like those that had evoked Niranjan\'s anger, he
curbed his temper and held his peace instead of threatening Sri
Ramakrishna\'s abusers. The Master, learning of his conduct, scolded him
roundly. Thus to each the fault of the other was recommended as a
virtue. The guru was striving to develop, in the first instance,
composure, and in the second, mettle. The secret of his training was to
build up, by a tactful recognition of the requirements of each given
case, the character of the devotee.</p>
<p>Jogindranāth came of an aristocratic brāhmin family of Dakshineśwar. His
father and relatives shared the popular mistrust of Sri Ramakrishna\'s
sanity. At a very early age the boy developed religious tendencies,
spending two or three hours daily in meditation, and his meeting with
Sri Ramakrishna deepened his desire for the realization of God. He had a
perfect horror of marriage. But at the earnest request of his mother he
had had to yield, and he now believed that his spiritual future was
doomed. So he kept himself away from the Master.</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna employed a ruse to bring Jogindra to him. As soon as the
disciple entered the room, the Master rushed forward to meet the young
man. Catching hold of the disciple\'s hand, he said: \"What if you have
married, Haven\'t I too married? What is there to be afraid of in
that?\" Touching his own chest he said:</p>
<p>\"If this [meaning himself] is propitious, then even a hundred
thousand marriages cannot injure you. It you desire to lead a
householder\'s life, then bring your wife here one day, and I shall see
that she becomes a real companion in your spiritual progress. But if you
want to lead a monastic life, then I shall eat up your attachment to the
world.\" Jogin was dumbfounded at these words. He received new strength,
and his spirit of renunciation was re-established.</p>
<p><strong>Śashi and Śarat</strong></p>
<p>Śashi and Śarat were two cousins who came from a pious brāhmin family of
Calcutta. At an early age they had joined the Brāhmo Samāj and had come
under the influence of Keshab Sen. The Master said to them at their
first meeting: \"If bricks and tiles are burnt after the trade-mark has
been stamped on them, they retain the mark for ever. Similarly, man
should be stamped with God before entering the world. Then he will not
become attached to worldliness.\" Fully aware of the future course of
their life, he asked them not to marry. The Master asked Śashi whether
he believed in God with form or in God without form. Śashi replied that
he was not even sure about the existence of God; so he could not speak
one way or the other. This frank answer very much pleased the Master.</p>
<p>Śarat\'s soul longed for the all-embracing realization of the Godhead.
When the Master inquired whether there was any particular form of God he
wished to see, the boy replied that he would like to see God in all the
living beings of the world. \"But\", the Master demurred, \"that is the
last word in realization. One cannot have it at the very outset.\" Śarat
stated calmly: \"I won\'t be satisfied with anything short of that. I
shall trudge on along the path till I attain that blessed state.\" Sri
Ramakrishna was very much pleased.</p>
<p><strong>Harināth</strong></p>
<p>Harināth had led the austere life of a <em>brahmachāri</em> even from his early
boyhood -bathing in the Ganges every day, cooking his own meals, waking
before sunrise, and reciting the Gita from memory before leaving bed. He
found in the Master the embodiment of the Vedānta scriptures. Aspiring
to be a follower of the ascetic Śankara, he cherished a great hatred for
women. One day he said to the Master that he could not allow even small
girls to come near him. The Master scolded him and said: \"You are
talking like a fool. Why should you hate women? They are the
manifestations of the Divine Mother. Regard them as your own mother and
you will never feel their evil influence. The more you hate them, the
more you will fall into their snares.\" Hari said later that these words
completely changed his attitude toward women.</p>
<p>The Master knew Hari\'s passion for Vedānta. But he did not wish any of
his disciples to become a dry ascetic or a mere bookworm. So he asked
Hari to practise Vedānta in life by giving up the unreal and following
the Real. \"But it is not so easy\", Sri Ramakrishna said, \"to realize
the illusoriness of the world. Study alone does not help one very much.
The grace of God is required. Mere personal effort is futile. A man is a
tiny creature after all, with very limited powers. But he can achieve
the impossible if he prays to God for His grace.\" Whereupon the Master
sang a song in praise of grace. Hari was profoundly moved and shed
tears. Later in life Hari achieved a wonderful synthesis of the ideals
of the Personal God and the Impersonal Truth.</p>
<p><strong>Gangādhar</strong></p>
<p>Gangādhar, Harināth\'s friend, also led the life of a strict
<em>brahmachari</em>, eating vegetarian food cooked by his own hands and
devoting himself to the study of the scriptures. He met the Master in
1884 and soon became a member of his inner circle. The Master praised
his ascetic habit and attributed it to the spiritual disciplines of his
past life. Gangādhar became a close companion of Narendra.</p>
<p><strong>Hariprasanna</strong></p>
<p>Hariprasanna, a college student, visited the Master in the company of
his friends Śashi and Śarat. Sri Ramakrishna showed him great favour by
initiating him into spiritual life. As long as he lived, Hariprasanna
remembered and observed the following drastic advice of the Master:
\"Even if a woman is pure as gold and rolls on the ground for love of
God, it is dangerous for a monk ever to look at her.\"</p>
<p><strong>Kāli</strong></p>
<p>Kāliprasād visited the Master toward the end of 1883. Given to the
practice of meditation and the study of the scriptures, Kāli was
particularly interested in yoga. Feeling the need of a guru in spiritual
life, he came to the Master and was accepted as a disciple. The young
boy possessed a rational mind and often felt sceptical about the
Personal God. The Master said to him: \"Your doubts will soon disappear.
Others, too, have passed through such a state of mind. Look at Naren. He
now weeps at the names of Rādhā and Krishna.\" Kāli began to see visions
of gods and goddesses. Very soon these disappeared and in meditation he
experienced vastness, infinity, and the other attributes of the
Impersonal Brahman.</p>
<p><strong>Subodh</strong></p>
<p>Subodh visited the Master in 1885. At the very first meeting Sri
Ramakrishna said to him: \"You will succeed. Mother says so. Those whom
She sends here will certainly attain spirituality.\" During the second
meeting the Master wrote something on Subodh\'s tongue, stroked his body
from the navel to the throat, and said, \"Awake, Mother! Awake.\" He
asked the boy to meditate. At once Subodh\'s latent spirituality was
awakened. He felt a current rushing along the spinal column to the
brain. Joy filled his soul.</p>
<p><strong>Sāradā and Tulasi</strong></p>
<p>Two more young men, Sāradā Prasanna and Tulasi, complete the small band
of the Master\'s disciples later to embrace the life of the wandering
monk. With the exception of the elder Gopāl, all of them were in their
teens or slightly over. They came from middle-class Bengāli families,
and most of them were students in school or college. Their parents and
relatives had envisaged for them bright worldly careers. They came to
Sri Ramakrishna with pure bodies, vigorous minds, and uncontaminated
souls. All were born with unusual spiritual attributes. Sri Ramakrishna
accepted them, even at first sight, as his children, relatives, friends,
and companions. His magic touch unfolded them. And later each according
to his measure reflected the life of the Master, becoming a torch-bearer
of his message across land and sea.</p>
<p><strong>Woman Devotees</strong></p>
<p>With his woman devotees Sri Ramakrishna established a very sweet
relationship. He himself embodied the tender traits of a woman; he had
dwelt on the highest plane of Truth, where there is not even the
slightest trace of sex; and his innate purity evoked only the noblest
emotion in men and women alike. His woman devotees often said: \"We
seldom looked on Sri Ramakrishna as a member of the male sex. We
regarded him as one of us. We never felt any constraint before him, He
was our best confidant.\" They loved him as their child, their friend,
and their teacher. In spiritual discipline he advised them to renounce
lust and greed and especially warned them not to fall into the snares of
men.</p>
<p><strong>Gopāl Mā</strong></p>
<p>Unsurpassed among the woman devotees of the Master in the richness of
her devotion and spiritual experiences was Aghoramani Devi, an orthodox
brāhmin woman. Widowed at an early age, she had dedicated</p>
<p>herself completely to spiritual pursuits. Gopālā, the Baby Krishna, was
her Ideal Deity, whom she worshipped following the <em>Vātsalya</em> attitude
of the Vaishnava religion, regarding Him as her own child. Through Him
she</p>
<p>satisfied her unassuaged maternal love, cooking for Him, feeding Him,
bathing Him, and putting Him to bed. This sweet intimacy with Gopālā won
her the sobriquet of Gopāl Mā, or Gopālā\'s Mother. For forty years she
had lived on the bank of the Ganges in a small bare room, her only
companions being a threadbare copy of the Ramayana and a bag containing
her rosary. At the age of sixty, in 1884, she visited Sri Ramakrishna at
Dakshineśwar. During the second visit, as soon as the Master saw her, he
said: \"Oh, you have come! Give me something to eat.\" With great
hesitation she gave him some ordinary sweets that she had purchased for
him on the way. The Master ate them with relish and asked her to bring
him simple curries or sweets prepared by her own hands. Gopāl Mā thought
him a queer kind of monk, for, instead of talking of God, he always
asked for food. She did not want to visit him again, but an irresistible
attraction brought her back to the temple garden. She carried with her
some simple curries that she had cooked herself.</p>
<p>One early morning at three o\'clock, about a year later, Gopāl Mā was
about to finish her daily devotions, when she was startled to find Sri
Ramakrishna sitting on her left, with his right hand clenched, like the
hand of the</p>
<p>image of Gopālā. She was amazed and caught hold of the hand, whereupon
the figure vanished and in its place appeared the real Gopālā, her Ideal
Deity. She cried aloud with joy. Gopālā begged her for butter. She
pleaded her poverty and gave Him some dry coconut candies. Gopālā sat on
her lap, snatched away her rosary, jumped on her shoulders, and moved
all about the room. As soon as the day broke she hastened to
Dakshineśwar like an insane woman. Of course Gopālā accompanied her,
resting His head on her shoulder. She clearly saw His tiny ruddy feet
hanging over her breast. She entered Sri Ramakrishna\'s room. The Master
had fallen into Samādhi. Like a child, he sat on her lap, and she began
to feed him with butter, cream, and other delicacies. After some time he
regained consciousness and returned to his bed. But the mind of
Gopālā\'s Mother was still roaming in another plane. She was steeped in
bliss. She saw Gopālā frequently entering the Master\'s body and again
coming out of it. When she returned to her hut, still in a dazed
condition, Gopālā accompanied her.</p>
<p>She spent about two months in uninterrupted communion with God, the Baby
Gopālā never leaving her for a moment. Then the intensity of her vision
was lessened; had it not been, her body would have perished. The Master
spoke highly of her exalted spiritual condition and said that such
vision of God was a rare thing for ordinary mortals. The fun-loving
Master one day confronted the critical Narendranāth with this
simple-minded woman. No two could have presented a more striking
contrast. The Master knew of Narendra\'s lofty contempt for all visions,
and he asked the old lady to narrate her experiences to Narendra. With
great hesitation she told him her story. Now and then she interrupted
her maternal chatter to ask Narendra: \"My son, I am a poor ignorant
woman. I don\'t understand anything. You are so learned. Now tell me if
these visions of Gopālā are true.\" As Narendra listened to the story he
was profoundly moved. He said, \"Yes, mother, they are quite true.\"
Behind his cynicism Narendra, too, possessed a heart full of love and
tenderness.</p>
<p><strong>The March of Events</strong></p>
<p>In 1882 Hriday was, dismissed from service in the Ka1i temple, for an
act of indiscretion, and was ordered by the authorities never again to
enter the garden. In a way the hand of the Divine Mother may be seen
even in this. Having taken care of Sri Ramakrishna during the stormy
days of his spiritual discipline, Hriday had come naturally to consider
himself the sole guardian of his uncle. None could approach the Master
without his knowledge. And he would be extremely jealous if Sri
Ramakrishna paid attention to anyone else. Hriday\'s removal made it
possible for the real devotees of the Master to approach him freely and
live with him in the temple garden.</p>
<p>During the week-ends the householders, enjoying a respite from their
office duties, visited the Master. The meetings on Sunday afternoons
were of the nature of little festivals. Refreshments were often served.
Professional musicians now and then sang devotional songs. The Master
and the devotees sang and danced, Sri Ramakrishna frequently going into
ecstatic moods. The happy memory of such a Sunday would linger long in
the minds of the devotees. Those whom the Master wanted for special
instruction he would ask to visit him on Tuesdays and Saturdays. These
days were particularly auspicious for the worship of Kāli.</p>
<p>The young disciples destined to be monks, Sri Ramakrishna invited on
week-days, when the householders were not present. The training of the
householders and of the future monks had to proceed along entirely
different lines. Since M. generally visited the Master on week-ends, the
Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna does not contain much mention of the future
monastic disciples.</p>
<p>Finally, there was a handful of fortunate disciples, householders as
well as youngsters, who were privileged to spend nights with the Master
in his room. They would see him get up early in the morning and walk up
and down the room, singing in his sweet voice and tenderly communing
with the Mother.</p>
<p><strong>Injury to the Master\'s Arm</strong></p>
<p>One day, in January 1884, the Master was going toward the pine-grove
when he went into a trance. He was alone. There was no one to support
him or guide his footsteps. He fell to the ground and dislocated a bone
in his left arm. This accident had a significant influence on his mind,
the natural inclination of which was to soar above the consciousness of
the body. The acute pain in the arm forced his mind to dwell on the body
and on</p>
<p>the world outside. But he saw even in this a divine purpose; for, with
his mind compelled to dwell on the physical plane, he realized more than
ever that he was an instrument in the hand of the Divine Mother, who had
a mission to fulfil through his human body and mind. He also distinctly
found that in the phenomenal world God manifests Himself, in an
inscrutable way, through diverse human beings, both good and evil. Thus
he would speak of God in the guise of the wicked, God in the guise of
the pious, God in the guise of the hypocrite, God in the guise of the
lewd. He began to take a special delight in watching the divine play in
the relative world. Sometimes the sweet human relationship with God
would appear to him more appealing than the all-effacing Knowledge of
Brahman. Many a time he would pray: \"Mother, don\'t make me unconscious
through the Knowledge of Brahman. Don\'t give me <em>Brahmajnāna,</em> Mother.
Am I not Your child, and naturally timid? I must have my Mother. A
million salutations to the Knowledge of Brahman! Give it to those who
want it.\" Again he prayed: \"O Mother, let me remain in contact with
men! Don\'t make me a dried-up ascetic. I want to enjoy Your sport in
the world.\" He was able to taste this very rich divine experience and
enjoy the love of God and the company of His devotees because his mind,
on account of the injury to his arm, was forced to come down to the
consciousness of the body. Again, he would make fun of people who
proclaimed him as a Divine Incarnation, by pointing to his broken arm.
He would say, \"Have you ever heard of God breaking His arm?\" It took
the arm about five months to heal.</p>
<p><strong>Beginning of His Illness</strong></p>
<p>In April 1885 the Master\'s throat became inflamed. Prolonged
conversation or absorption in Samādhi, making the blood flow into the
throat, would aggravate the pain. Yet when the annual Vaishnava festival
was celebrated at Pānihāti, Sri Ramakrishna attended it against the
doctor\'s advice. With a group of disciples he spent himself in music,
dance, and ecstasy. The illness took a turn for the worse and was
diagnosed as \"clergyman\'s sore throat\". The patient was cautioned
against conversation and ecstasies. Though he followed the physician\'s
directions regarding medicine and diet, he could neither control his
trances nor withhold from seekers the solace of his advice. Sometimes,
like a sulky child, he would complain to the Mother about the crowds,
who gave him no rest day or night. He was overheard to say to Her: \"Why
do You bring here all these worthless people, who are like milk diluted
with five times its own quantity of water? My eyes are almost destroyed
with blowing the fire to dry up the water. My health is gone. It is
beyond my strength. Do it Yourself, if You want it done. This (pointing
to his own body) is but a perforated drum, and if you go on beating it
day in and day out, how long will it last?\"</p>
<p>But his large heart never turned anyone away. He said, \"Let me be
condemned to be born over and over again, even in the form of a dog, if
I can be of help to a single soul.\" And he bore the pain, singing
cheerfully, \"Let the body be preoccupied with illness, but, O mind,
dwell for ever in God\'s Bliss!\"</p>
<p>One night he had a haemorrhage of the throat. The doctor now diagnosed
the illness as cancer. Narendra was the first to break this
heart-rending news to the disciples. Within three days the Master was
removed to Calcutta for better treatment. At Balarām\'s house he
remained a week until a suitable place could be found at Śyāmpukur, in
the northern section of Calcutta. During this week he dedicated himself
practically without respite to the instruction of those beloved devotees
who had been unable to visit him oftener at Dakshineśwar. Discourses
incessantly flowed from his tongue, and he often went into Samādhi. Dr.
Mahendra Sarkār, the celebrated homeopath of Calcutta, was invited to
undertake his treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Śyāmpukur</strong></p>
<p>In the beginning of September 1885 Sri Ramakrishna was moved to
Śyāmpukur. Here Narendra organized the young disciples to attend the
Master day and night. At first they concealed the Master\'s illness from
their guardians; but when it became more serious they remained with him
almost constantly, sweeping aside the objections of their relatives and
devoting themselves whole-heartedly to the nursing of their beloved
guru. These young men, under the watchful eyes of the Master and the
leadership of Narendra, became the <em>Antaranga</em> Bhaktās, the devotees of
Sri Ramakrishna\'s inner circle. They were privileged to witness many
manifestations of the Master\'s divine powers. Narendra received
instructions regarding the propagation of his message after his death.</p>
<p>The Holy Mother - so Sāradā Devi had come to be affectionately known by
Sri Ramakrishna\'s devotees - was brought from Dakshineśwar to look
after the general cooking and to prepare the special diet of the
patient. The dwelling space being extremely limited, she had to adapt
herself to cramped conditions. At three o\'clock in the morning she
would finish her bath in the Ganges and then enter a small covered place
on the roof, where she spent the whole day cooking and praying. After
eleven at night, when the visitors went away, she would come down to her
small bedroom on the first floor to enjoy a few hours\' sleep. Thus she
spent three months, working hard, sleeping little, and praying
constantly for the Master\'s recovery.</p>
<p>At Śyāmpukur the devotees led an intense life. Their attendance on the
Master was in itself a form of spiritual discipline. His mind was
constantly soaring to an exalted plane of consciousness. Now and then
they would catch the contagion of his spiritual fervour. They sought to
divine the meaning of this illness of the Master, whom most of them had
accepted as an Incarnation of God. One group, headed by Girish with his
robust optimism and great power of imagination, believed that the
illness was a mere pretext to serve a deeper purpose. The Master had
willed his illness in order to bring the devotees together and promote
solidarity among them. As soon as this purpose was served, he would
himself get rid of the disease. A second group thought that the Divine
Mother, in whose hand the Master was an instrument, had brought about
this illness to serve Her own mysterious ends. But the young
rationalists, led by Narendra, refused to ascribe a supernatural cause
to a natural phenomenon. They believed that the Master\'s body, a
material thing, was subject, like all other material things, to physical
laws. Growth, development, decay, and death were laws of nature to which
the Master\'s body could not but respond. But though holding differing
views, they all believed that it was to him alone that they must look
for the attainment of their spiritual goal.</p>
<p>In spite of the physician\'s efforts and the prayers and nursing of the
devotees, the illness rapidly progressed. The pain sometimes appeared to
be unbearable. The Master lived only on liquid food, and his frail body
was becoming a mere skeleton. Yet his face always radiated joy, and he
continued to welcome the visitors pouring in to receive his blessing.
When certain zealous devotees tried to keep the visitors away, they were
told by Girish, \"You cannot succeed in it; he has been born for this
very purpose - to sacrifice himself for the redemption of others.\"</p>
<p>The more the body was devastated by illness, the more it became the
habitation of the Divine Spirit. Through its transparency the gods and
goddesses began to shine with ever increasing luminosity. On the day of
the Kāli Puja the devotees clearly saw in him the manifestation of the
Divine Mother.</p>
<p>It was noticed at this time that some of the devotees were making an
unbridled display of their emotions. A number of them, particularly
among the householders, began to cultivate, though at first
unconsciously, the art of shedding tears, shaking the body, contorting
the face, and going into trances, attempting thereby to imitate the
Master. They began openly to declare Sri Ramakrishna a Divine
Incarnation and to regard themselves as his chosen people, who could
neglect religious disciplines with impunity. Narendra\'s penetrating eye
soon sized up the situation. He found out that some of these external
manifestations were being carefully practised at home, while some were
the outcome of malnutrition, mental weakness, or nervous debility. He
mercilessly exposed the devotees who were pretending to have visions,
and asked all to develop a healthy religious spirit. Narendra sang
inspiring songs for the younger devotees, read with them the Imitation
of Christ and the Gita, and held before them the positive ideals of
spirituality.</p>
<p><strong>Last Days at Cossipore</strong></p>
<p>When Sri Ramakrishna\'s illness showed signs of aggravation, the
devotees, following the advice of Dr. Sarkār, rented a spacious garden
house at Cossipore, in the northern suburbs of Calcutta. The Master was
removed to this place on December 11, 1885.</p>
<p>It was at Cossipore that the curtain fell on the varied activities of
the Master\'s life on the physical plane. His soul lingered in the body
eight months more. It was the period of his great Passion, a constant
crucifixion of the body and the triumphant revelation of the Soul. Here
one sees the humanity and divinity of the Master passing and repassing
across a thin border line. Every minute of those eight months was
suffused with touching</p>
<p>tenderness of heart and breath-taking elevation of spirit. Every word he
uttered was full of pathos and sublimity.</p>
<p>It took the group only a few days to become adjusted to the new
environment. The Holy Mother, assisted by Sri Ramakrishna\'s niece,
Lakshmi Devi, and a few woman devotees, took charge of the cooking for
the Master and his attendants. Surendra willingly bore the major portion
of the expenses, other householders contributing according to their
means. Twelve disciples were constant attendants of the Master:
Narendra, Rākhāl, Bāburām, Niranjan, Jogin, Lātu, Tārak, the elder
Gopāl, Kāli, Śashi, Śarat, and the younger Gopāl. Sāradā, Harish, Hari,
Gangādhar, and Tulasi visited the Master from time to time and practised
sādhana at home. Narendra, preparing for his law examination, brought
his books to the garden house in order to continue his studies during
the infrequent spare moments. He encouraged his brother disciples to
intensify their meditation, scriptural studies, and other spiritual
disciplines. They all forgot their relatives and their worldly duties.</p>
<p>Among the attendants Śashi was the embodiment of service. He did not
practise meditation, japa, or any of the other disciplines followed by
his brother devotees. He was convinced that service to the guru was the
only religion for him. He forgot food and rest and was ever ready at the
Master\'s bedside.</p>
<p>Pundit Śaśadhar one day suggested to the Master that the latter could
remove the illness by concentrating his mind on the throat, the
scriptures having declared that yogis had power to cure themselves in
that way. The Master rebuked the pundit. \"For a scholar like you to
make such a proposal!\" he said. \"How can I withdraw the mind from the
Lotus Feet of God and turn it to this worthless cage of flesh and
blood?\" \"For our sake at least\", begged Narendra and the other
disciples. \"But\", replied Sri Ramakrishna, \"do you think I enjoy this
suffering? I wish to recover, but that depends on the Mother.\"</p>
<p>NARENDRA: \"Then please pray to Her. She must listen to you.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"But I cannot pray for my body.\"</p>
<p>NARENDRA: \"You must do it, for our sake at least.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Very well, I shall try.\"</p>
<p>A few hours later the Master said to Narendra: \"I said to Her:
\'Mother, I cannot swallow food because of my pain. Make it possible for
me to eat a little.\' She pointed you all out to me and said: \'What?
You are eating enough through all these mouths. Isn\'t that so?\' I was
ashamed and could not utter another word.\" This dashed all the hopes of
the devotees for the Master\'s recovery.</p>
<p>\"I shall make the whole thing public before I go\", the Master had said
some time before. On January 1, 1886, he felt better and came down to
the garden for a little stroll. It was about three o\'clock in the
afternoon. Some thirty lay disciples were in the hall or sitting about
under the trees. Sri Ramakrishna said to Girish, \"Well, Girish, what
have you seen in me, that you proclaim me before everybody as an
Incarnation of God?\" Girish was not the man to be taken by surprise. He
knelt before the Master and said with folded hands, \"What can an
insignificant person like myself say about the One whose glory even
sages like Vyāsa and Vālmiki could not adequately measure?\" The Master
was profoundly moved. He said: \"What more shall I say? I bless you all.
Be illumined!\" He fell into a spiritual mood. Hearing these words the
devotees, one and all, became overwhelmed with emotion. They rushed to
him and fell at his feet. He touched them all, and each received an
appropriate benediction. Each of them, at the touch of the Master,
experienced ineffable bliss. Some laughed, some wept, some sat down to
meditate, some began to pray. Some saw light, some had visions of their
Chosen Ideals, and some felt within their bodies the rush of spiritual
power.</p>
<p>Narendra, consumed with a terrific fever for realization, complained to
the Master that all the others had attained peace and that he alone was
dissatisfied. The Master asked what he wanted. Narendra begged for
Samādhi, so that he might altogether forget the world for three or four
days at a time. \"You are a fool\", the Master rebuked him. \"There is a
state even higher than that. Isn\'t it you who sing, \'All that exists
art Thou\'? First of all settle your family affairs and then come to me.
You will experience a state even higher than Samādhi.\"</p>
<p>The Master did not hide the fact that he wished to make Narendra his
spiritual heir. Narendra was to continue the work after Sri
Ramakrishna\'s passing. Sri Ramakrishna said to him: \"I leave these
young men in your charge. See that they develop their spirituality and
do not return home.\" One day he asked the boys, in preparation for a
monastic life, to beg their food from door to door without thought of
caste. They hailed the Master\'s order and went out with begging-bowls.
A few days later he gave the ochre cloth of the sannyāsi to each of
them, including Girish, who was now second to none in his spirit of
renunciation. Thus the Master himself laid the foundation of the future
Ramakrishna Order of monks.</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna was sinking day by day. His diet was reduced to a
minimum and he found it almost impossible to swallow. He whispered to
M.: \"I am bearing all this cheerfully, for otherwise you would be
weeping. If you all say that it is better that the body should go rather
than suffer this torture, I am willing.\" The next morning he said to
his depressed disciples seated near the bed: \"Do you know what I see? I
see that God alone has become everything. Men and animals are only
frameworks covered with skin, and it is He who is moving through their
heads and limbs. I see that it is God Himself who has become the block,
the executioner, and the victim for the sacrifice.\" He fainted with
emotion. Regaining partial consciousness, he said: \"Now I have no pain.
I am very well.\" Looking at Lātu he said: \"There sits Lātu resting his
head on the palm of his hand. To me it is the Lord who is seated in that
posture.\"</p>
<p>The words were tender and touching. Like a mother he caressed Narendra
and Rākhāl, gently stroking their faces. He said in a half whisper to
M., \"Had this body been allowed to last a little longer, many more
souls would have been illumined.\" He paused a moment and then said:
\"But Mother has ordained otherwise. She will take me away lest, finding
me guileless and foolish, people should take advantage of me and
persuade me to bestow on them the rare gifts of spirituality.\" A few
minutes later he touched his chest and said: \"Here are two beings. One
is She and the other is Her devotee. It is the latter who broke his arm,
and it is he again who is now ill. Do you understand me?\" After a pause
he added: \"Alas! To whom shall I tell all this? Who will understand
me?\" \"Pain\", he consoled them again, \"is unavoidable as long as
there is a body. The Lord takes on the body for the sake of His
devotees.\"</p>
<p>Yet one is not sure whether the Master\'s soul actually was tortured by
this agonizing disease. At least during his moments of spiritual
exaltation - which became almost constant during the closing days of his
life on earth</p>
<ol>
<li>he lost all consciousness of the body, of illness and suffering. One
    of his attendants said later on: \"While Sri Ramakrishna lay sick he
    never actually suffered pain. He would often say: \'O mind! Forget
    the body, forget the sickness, and remain merged in Bliss.\' No, he
    did not really suffer. At times, he would be in a state when the
    thrill of joy was clearly manifested in his body. Even when he could
    not speak he would let us know in some way that there was no
    suffering, and this fact was clearly evident to all who watched him.
    People who did not understand him thought that his suffering was
    very great. What spiritual joy he transmitted to us at that time!</li>
</ol>
<p>Could such a thing have been possible if he had been suffering
physically? It was during this period that he taught us again these
truths. \'Brahman is always unattached. The three <em>gunās</em> are in It, but
It is unaffected by them, just as the wind carries odour yet remains
odourless.\' \'Brahman is Infinite Being, In finite Wisdom, Infinite
Bliss. In It there exist no delusion, no misery, no disease, no death,
no growth, no decay.\' \'The Transcendental Being and the being within
are one and the same. There is one indivisible Absolute Existence.\' \"</p>
<p>The Holy Mother secretly went to a Śiva temple across the Ganges to
intercede with the Deity for the Master\'s recovery. In a revelation she
was told to prepare herself for the inevitable end.</p>
<p>One day when Narendra was on the ground floor, meditating, the Master
was lying awake in his bed upstairs. In the depths of his meditation
Narendra felt as though a lamp were burning at the back of his head.
Suddenly he lost consciousness. It was the yearned-for, all-effacing
experience of nirvikalpa Samādhi, when the embodied soul realizes its
unity with the Absolute. After a very long time he regained partial
consciousness but was unable to find his body. He could see only his
head. \"Where is my body?\" he cried. The elder Gopāl entered the room
and said, \"Why, it is here, Naren!\" But Narendra could not find it.
Gopāl, frightened, ran upstairs to the Master. Sri Ramakrishna only
said: \"Let him stay that way for a time. He has worried me long</p>
<p><em>Mahā--samādhi,</em></p>
<p>enough.\"</p>
<p>After another long period Narendra regained full consciousness. Bathed
in peace, he went to the Master, who said: \"Now the Mother has shown
you everything. But this revelation will remain under lock and key, and
I shall keep the key. When you have accomplished the Mother\'s work you
will find the treasure again.\"</p>
<p>Some days later, Narendra being alone with the Master, Sri Ramakrishna
looked at him and went into Samādhi. Narendra felt the penetration of a
subtle force and lost all outer consciousness. Regaining presently the
normal mood, he found the Master weeping.</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna said to him: \"Today I have given you my all and I am
now only a poor fakir, possessing nothing. By this power you will do
immense good in the world, and not until it is accomplished will you
return.\" Henceforth the Master lived in the disciple.</p>
<p>Doubt, however, dies hard. After one or two days Narendra said to
himself, \"If in the midst of this racking physical pain he declares his
Godhead, then only shall I accept him as an Incarnation of God.\" He was
alone by the bedside of the Master. It was a passing thought, but the
Master smiled. Gathering his remaining strength, he distinctly said,
\"He who was Rāmā and Krishna is now, in this body, Ramakrishna - but
not in your Vedāntic sense.\" Narendra was stricken with shame.</p>
<p><strong>Mahā--samādhi</strong></p>
<p>Sunday, August 15, 1886. The Master\'s pulse became irregular. The
devotees stood by the bedside. Toward dusk Sri Ramakrishna had
difficulty in breathing. A short time afterwards he complained of
hunger. A little liquid food was put into his mouth; some of it he
swallowed, and the rest ran over his chin. Two attendants began to fan
him. All at once he went into Samādhi of a rather unusual type. The body
became stiff. Śaśi burst into tears. But after midnight the Master
revived. He was now very hungry and helped himself to a bowl of
porridge. He said he was strong again. He sat up against five or six
pillows, which were supported by the body of Śashi, who was fanning him.
Narendra took his feet on his lap and began to rub them. Again and
again, the Master repeated to him, \"Take care of these boys.\" Then, he
asked to lie down. Three times in ringing tones he cried the name of
<strong>Kāli,</strong> his life\'s Beloved, and lay back. At two minutes past one
there was a low sound in his throat and he fell a little to one side. A
thrill passed over his body. His hair stood on end. His eyes became</p>
<p>fixed on the tip of his nose. His face was lighted with a smile. The
final ecstasy began. It was total absorption, from which his mind never
returned. Narendra, unable to bear it, ran downstairs.</p>
<p>Dr. Sarkār arrived the following noon and pronounced that life had
departed not more than half an hour before. At five o\'clock the
Master\'s body was brought downstairs, laid on a cot, dressed in ochre
clothes, and decorated with sandal-past and flowers. A procession was
formed. The passers-by wept as the body was taken to the cremation
ground at the Bārānagore Ghāt on the Ganges.</p>
<p>While the devotees were returning to the garden house, carrying the urn
with the sacred ashes, a calm resignation came to their souls and they
cried, \"Victory unto the Guru!\"</p>
<p>The Holy Mother was weeping in her room, not for her husband, but
because she felt that Mother Kāli had left her. As she was about to put
off the marks of a Hindu widow, in a moment of revelation she heard the
words of faith \"I have only passed from one room to another.\"</p>
