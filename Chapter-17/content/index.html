<p>WITH THE DEVOTEES AT DAKSHINESWAR (II)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sunday, December 9, 1883</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Chaitanya\'s exalted state</strong></p>
<p>SRI RAMAKRISHNA was seated on the small couch in his room with Adhar,
Manomohan, Rākhāl , M., Harish, and other devotees. It was about two o\'
clock in the afternoon. The Master was describing to them the exalted
state of Sri Chaitanya.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Chaitanya experienced three states of mind. First, the
conscious state, when his mind dwelt on the gross and the subtle.
Second, the semi-conscious state, when his mind entered the causal body
and was absorbed in the bliss of divine intoxication. Third, the inmost
state, when his mind was merged in the Great Cause.</p>
<p>This agrees very well with the five koshas, or \'sheaths\', described in
the Vedānta. The gross body corresponds to the annamayakosha and the
pranamayakosha, the subtle body to the manomayakosha and the
vijnanamayakosha, and the causal body to the Ānandamayakosha. The
Mahakarana, the Great Cause, is beyond the five sheaths. When
Chaitanya\'s mind merged in That, he would go into samādhi. This is
called the nirvikalpa or jada samādhi.</p>
<p>\"While conscious of the outer world, Chaitanya sang the name of God;
while in the state of partial consciousness, he danced with the
devotees; and while in the inmost state of consciousness, he remained
absorbed in samādhi.\"</p>
<p>M. (to himself): \"Is the Master hinting at the different states of his
own mind? There is much similarity between Chaitanya and the Master.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Chaitanya was Divine Love incarnate. He came down to earth to
teach people how to love God. One achieves everything when one loves
God. There is no need of hathayoga.\"</p>
<p><strong>Practice of Hathayoga</strong></p>
<p>A DEVOTEE: \"Sir, what is hathayoga like?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"A man practising hathayoga dwells a great deal on his body. He
washes his intestines by means of a bamboo tube through his anus. He
draws ghee and milk through his sexual organ. He learns how to
manipulate his tongue by performing exercises. He sits in a fixed
posture and bow and then levitates. All these are actions of prana. A
magician was performing his feats when his tongue turned up and clove to
the roof of his mouth. Immediately his body became motionless. People
thought he was dead. He was buried and remained many years in the grave.
After a long time the grave somehow broke open. Suddenly the man
regained consciousness of the world and cried out, \'Come delusion! Come
confusion!\' (All laugh.) All these are actions of prana.</p>
<p>\"The Vedantists do not accept hathayoga. There is also rajayoga.
Rajayoga describes how to achieve union with God through the mind by
means of discrimination and bhakti. This yoga is good. Hathayoga is not
good. The life of a man in the Kaliyuga is dependent on food.\"</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna was standing in the road by the side of the nahabat. He
was on his way to his room, having come from the pine-grove. He saw M.
seated on the verandah of the nahabat, behind the fence, absorbed in
meditation.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Hello! You are here? You will get results very soon. If you
practise a little, then someone will come</p>
<p>forward to help you.\"</p>
<p>M. looked up at the Master, startled; he remained sitting on the floor.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"The time is ripe for you. The mother bird does not break the
shell of the egg until the right time arrives. What I told you is indeed
your Ideal.\"</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna again mentioned to M. his spiritual Ideal.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"It is not necessary for all to practise great austerity. But I
went through great suffering. I used to lie on the ground with my head
resting on a mound for a pillow. I hardly noticed the passing of the
days. I only called on God and wept, \'O Mother! O Mother!\'\"</p>
<p>M. had been visiting Sri Ramakrishna for the past two years. Since he
had been educated along English lines, he had acquired a fondness for
Western philosophy and science, and had liked to hear Keshab and other
scholars lecture. Sri Ramakrishna would address him now and then as the
\"English-man\". Since coming to Sri Ramakrishna, M. had lost all relish
for lectures and for books written by English scholars. The only thing
that appealed to him now was to see the Master day and night, and hear
the words that fell from his blessed lips. M. constantly dwelt on
certain of Sri Ramakrishna\'s sayings. The Master had said, \"One can
certainly see God through the practice of spiritual discipline\", and
again, \"The vision of God is the only goal of human life.\"</p>
<p>MASTER (to M.): \"If you practise only a little, someone will come
forward to tell you the right path. Observe the ekadasi.</p>
<p><strong>Master\'s intimate relationship with disciples</strong></p>
<p>\"You are my very own, my relative; otherwise, why should you come here
so frequently? While listening to the kirtan, I had a vision of Rākhāl
in the midst of Sri Krishna\'s companions in Vrindāvan. Narendra belongs
to a very high level. Hirananda too; how childlike his nature is! What
sweet disposition he has! I want to see him too.</p>
<p>\"Once I saw the companions of Chaitanya, not in a trance but with these
very eyes. Formerly I was in such an exalted state of mind that I could
see all these things with my naked eyes; but now I see them in samādhi.
I saw the companions of Chaitanya with these naked eyes. I think I saw
you there, and Balarām too, You must have noticed that when I see
certain people I jump up with a start. Do you know why? A man feels that
way when he sees his own people after a long time.</p>
<p>\"I used to pray to the Mother, crying: \'Mother, if I do not find the
devotees I\'ll surely die. Please bring them to me immediately.\' In
those days whatever desire arose in my mind would come to pass. I
planted a tulsi-grove in the Panchavati in order to practise japa and
meditation. I wanted very much to fence it around with bamboo sticks.
Soon afterwards a bundle of bamboo sticks and some string were carried
by the flood-tide of the Ganges right in front of the Panchavati. A
temple servant noticed them and joyfully told me.</p>
<p>\"In that state of divine exaltation I could no longer perform the
formal worship. \'Mother,\' I said, \'who will look after me? I haven\'t
the power to take care of myself. I want to listen only to talk about
Thee. I want to feed Thy devotees. I want to give a little help to those
whom I chance to meet. How will all that be possible, Mother? Give me a
rich man to stand by me.\' That is why Mathur Babu did so much to serve
me.</p>
<p>\"I said further, \'Certainly I shall not have any children, Mother. But
it is my desire that a boy with sincere love for God should always
remain with me. Give me such a boy.\' That is the reason Rākhāl came
here. Those whom I think of as my own are part and parcel of me.\"</p>
<p>The Master started again for the Panchavati accompanied by M. No one
else was with them. Sri Ramakrishna with a smile narrated to him various
incidents of the past years of his life.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"You see, one day I. saw a strange figure covering the whole
space from the Kāli temple to the Panchavati. Do you believe this?\"</p>
<p>M. remained silent with wonder. He plucked one or two leaves from a
branch in the Panchavati and put them in his pocket.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"See there-that branch has been broken. I used to sit under
it.\"</p>
<ol>
<li>\"I took a young twig from that tree-I have it at home.\" MASTER
    (with a smile): \"Why?\"</li>
</ol>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
23. \"I feel happy when I look at it. After all this is over, this place
    will be considered very holy.\" MASTER (smiling): \"What kind of
    holy place? Like Panihati?\"</p>
<p>Almost every year, for some time past, the Master had been attending the
religious festival at Panihati.</p>
<p>It was evening. Sri Ramakrishna was sitting on the small couch in his
room, absorbed in meditation on the Divine Mother. The evening worship
in the temples began, with the music of gong and conch-shell. M. was
going to spend the night with the Master.</p>
<p>Ater a time Sri Ramakrishna asked M. to read from the Bhaktamala, a book
about the Vaishnava saints.</p>
<p><strong>Story of a Vaishnava devotee</strong></p>
<p>M. read: "There was a king named Jayamal who loved Krishna with all his
heart. He followed with unfailing devotion all the rites and ceremonies
associated with the adoration of Krishna, whom he worshipped under the
name of Syamalasundara. Completely satisfied with his own Ideal Deity,
he never directed his attention to any other god or goddess. One of the
inflexible rules of his devotions was to worship the Deity daily till
almost midday. He would never deviate from this practice, even at the
risk of his wealth or his kingdom. Learning this secret, an enemy king
invaded the kingdom during the morning hours. Jayamal\'s soldiers could
not fight without his command; so they watched the invasion silently.
Slowly the enemy surrounded the moat of the capital; yet Jayamal did not
come out of his shrine room. His mother came to him and wept bitterly,
trying to persuade the king to fight. He said to her calmly: \"Why are
you worried? Syamalasundara gave me this kingdom. What can I do if He
has decided to take it away? On the other hand, none will be able to do
me harm if He protects me. Our own efforts are vain!<em>\"</em></p>
<p>And actually, in the mean time, Syamalasundara, the Deity Himself, had
taken the king\'s horse from the stable and had ridden fully armed to
the field. Alone He faced the hostile king and alone destroyed his army.
Having crushed the enemy forces, the Deity returned to the temple and
fastened the horse near by.</p>
<p>Jayamal, on completing his worship, came out and discovered the horse
there, panting and covered with sweat. \"Who has been riding my horse?\"
he demanded. \"Who brought it to the temple?\" The officers declared
they knew nothing about it. In a pensive mood the king proceeded to the
battle-field with his army and there found the enemy, with the exception
of their leader, lying dead. He was staring uncomprehendingly at the
scene, when the enemy king approached, worshipped him, and said:
\"Please permit me to tell you something. How could I fight? You have a
warrior who could conquer the entire world. I do not want your wealth or
your kingdom; indeed, I will gladly give you my own, if you will tell me
about that Blue Warrior, your friend. No sooner did I turn my eyes on
him than he cast a spell on my heart and soul.\"</p>
<p>Jayamal then realized it had been none other than Syamalasundara that
had appeared on the battle-field. The enemy king understood too. He
worshipped Jayamal and through his blessings received Krishna\'s grace.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Do you believe all that? Do you believe Krishna rode on that
horse and killed Jayamal\'s enemies?\"</p>
<ol>
<li>\"I believe that Jayamal, Krishna\'s devotee, prayed to Him with a
    yearning heart. But I don\'t know whether the enemy really saw Him
    coming to the battle-field on a horse. Krishna might have come there
    riding the horse, but I do not know whether they really saw Him.\"</li>
</ol>
<p>MASTER (with a smile): \"The book contains nice stories about devotees.
But it is one-sided. Also, it abuses those who differ with its views.\"</p>
<p>The following morning the Master and M. were talking in the garden.</p>
<p>M: \"Then I shall stay here.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Well, you all come here so often. What does it mean? People
visit a holyman once at the most. But you all come here so often. What
is the significance of that?\"</p>
<p>M. remained silent. The Master himself gave the reply.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Could you come here unless you belonged to my inner circle?
That means you all are my own relatives, my own people-like father and
son, brother and sister.</p>
<p>\"I do not tell you everything. If I did, would you come here any more?</p>
<p>\"Once Sukadeva went to Janaka to be instructed in the Knowledge of
Brahman; Janaka said, \'First give me my fee.\' \'But\', said Sukadeva,
\'why should I give you the fee before receiving the instruction?\'
Janaka laughed and said: \'Will you be conscious of guru and disciple
after attaining Brahmajnana? That is why I asked you to give me the fee
first.\' \"</p>
<p>It was night. The moon rose, flooding all the quarters with its silvery
light. M. was walking alone in the garden of the temple. On one side of
the path stood the Panchavati, the bakul-grove, the nahabat, and the
Master\'s room, and on the other side flowed the Ganges, reflecting
millions of broken moons on its rippling surface.</p>
<p>M. said to himself: \"Can one really see God? The Master says it is
possible. He says that, if one makes a little effort, then someone comes
forward and shows the way. Well, I am married. I have children. Can one
realize God in spite of all that?\"</p>
<p>M. reflected awhile and continued his soliloquy: \"Surely one can.
Otherwise, why should the Master say so?</p>
<p>Why shouldn\'t it be possible through the grace of God?</p>
<p>\"Here is the world around me-the sun, moon, stars, living beings, and
the twenty-four cosmic principles. How did they come into existence? Who
is their Creator? What am I to Him? Life is indeed vain without this
knowledge.</p>
<p>\"Sri Ramakrishna is certainly the best of men. In all my life I have
not seen another great soul like him. He must have seen God. Otherwise,
how could he talk with God day and night, addressing Him so intimately
as \'Mother\'? Otherwise, how could he love God so intimately? Such is
his love for God that he forgets the outer world. He goes into samādhi
and remains like a lifeless thing. Again, in the ecstasy of that love,
he laughs and cries and dances and sings.\"</p>
<p><strong>Friday, December 14, 1883</strong></p>
<p>At nine o\'clock in the morning Sri Ramakrishna was standing on the
southeast verandah near the door of his room, with Ramlal by his side.
Rākhāl and Lātu were moving about. M. arrived and prostrated himself
before the Master. Sri Ramakrishna said to him affectionately: \"You
have come. That\'s very good. Today is an auspicious day.\"</p>
<p>It was the last day of the Bengali month and the day of the full moon.
M. was going to spend a few days with</p>
<p>the Master practising spiritual discipline. The Master had said to him,
\"If an aspirant practises a little spiritual discipline, then someone
comes forward to help him.\"</p>
<p>The Master had said to M: \"You should not eat every day at the
guesthouse of the Kāli temple. The guest-house is intended to supply
free food to monks and the destitute. Bring your own cook with you.\" M.
had accordingly done so. The Master arranged a place for the man to cook
and he asked Ramlal to speak to the milkman about milk.</p>
<p>A little later Ramlal began to read from the Adhyātma Rāmāyana. The
Master and M. listened while he read:</p>
<p>Rāma had married Sita after breaking the great bow of Śiva. On the way
to Ayhodhya with His bride, Rāma was confronted by the warrior sage
Parasurama, who was about to make trouble for Him. Parasurama threw a
bow at Rāma and challenged Him to string it. Dasaratha, Rāma\'s father,
was seized with fear. With a smile, Rāma took the bow in His left hand
and strung it. Then twanging the bow-string, He fixed an arrow and asked
Parasurama where to shoot it. That curbed the pride of the warrior sage.
Prostrating himself before Rāma, Parasurama worshipped Him as the
Supreme Brahman.</p>
<p>As Sri Ramakrishna listened to Parasurama\'s hymn, he went into a
spiritual mood and now and then chanted the name of Rāma in his
melodious voice.</p>
<p>Then the Master asked Ramlal to read about Guhaka. Ramlal read:</p>
<p>Guhaka, the pariah, was chief of the untouchables and an intimate friend
of Rāma. When Rāma, Sita, and Lakshmana were starting into the forest to
redeem Dasaratha\'s pledge, Guhaka ferried them across the river. Rāma
embraced Guhaka tenderly and told him He was going to spend fourteen
years in exile, wearing the bark of trees and eating herbs, fruits, and
roots that grew in the woods. He promised to visit Guhaka again on His
way back to Ayhodhya after the period of exile was over. The pariah king
waited patiently. But when the fourteenth year had run out and Rāma had
not returned, Guhaka lighted a funeral pyre. He was on the point of
entering it when Hanuman arrived as Rāma\'s messenger. In a celestial
chariot Rāma and Sita soon appeared, and Guhaka\'s joy was unbounded.</p>
<p>After the midday meal Sri Ramakrishna lay down on his bed to rest. M.
was seated on the floor. Presently Dr. Shyama and a few devotees
arrived. The Master sat up on the bed and began to converse with them.</p>
<p><strong>Work and worship</strong></p>
<p>MASTER: \"It is by no means necessary for a man always to be engaged in
his duties. Actions drop away when one realizes, God, as the flower
drops of itself when the fruit appears.</p>
<p>\"He who has realized God no longer performs religious duties such as
the sandhya. In his case the sandhya merges in the Gayatri. When that
happens, it is enough for a person to repeat just the Gayatri mantra.
Then the Gayatri merges in Om. After that one no longer chants even the
Gayatri; it is enough then to chant simply Om. How long should a man
practise such devotions as the sandhya? As long as he does not feel a
thrill in his body and shed tears of joy while repeating the name of
Rāma or of Hari. People worship God to win money or a lawsuit. That is
not good.\"</p>
<p>A DEVOTEE: \"We find that everyone strives after money. Even Keshab Sen
married his daughter to a prince.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Keshab\'s case is quite different. God provides everything for
a genuine devotee, even without his making any effort. The son of a real
king gets his monthly allowance. I am not talking of lawyers and men of
that sort, who go through suffering in order to earn money, and who
become slaves of others to that end. I am speaking of a real prince. A
true devotee has no desire. He does not care for money. Money comes to
him of itself. The Gitā describes such a devotee as \'content with what
comes to him without effort\'. A good brahmin, without any personal
motive, can accept food even from the house of an untouchable. He does
not desire it; it comes of its own accord.\"</p>
<p><strong>How to live in the world</strong></p>
<p>A DEVOTEE: \"Sir, how should one live in the world?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Live in the world as the mud fish lives in the mud. One
develops love of God by going away from the world into solitude, now and
then, and meditating on God. After that one can live in the world
unattached. The mud is there, and the fish has to live in it, but its
body is not stained by the mud. Such a man can lead the life of a
householder in a spirit of detachment\"</p>
<p>The Master noticed that M. was listening to his words with great
attention.</p>
<p>MASTER (looking at M.): \"One can realize God if one feels intense
dispassion for worldly things. A man with such dispassion feels that the
world is like a forest on fire. He regards his wife and children as a
deep well. If he really feels that kind of dispassion, he renounces home
and family. It is not enough for him to live in the world in a spirit of
detachment.</p>
<ol>
<li>\'Woman and gold\' alone is maya. If maya is once recognized, it
    feels ashamed of itself and takes to flight. A man put on a tiger
    skin and tried to frighten another man. But the latter said: \'Ah! I
    have recognized you! You are our Hare.\' At that the man dressed in
    the skin went away smiling to frighten someone else.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Women as embodiments of the Divine Mother</strong></p>
<p>\"All women are the embodiments of Śakti. It is the Primal Power that
has become women and appears to us in the form of women. It is said in
the Adhyātma Rāmāyana that Nārada and others praised Rāma, saying: \'O
Rāma, Thou alone art all that we see as male, and Sita, all that we see
as female. Thou art Indra, and Sita is Indrani; Thou art Śiva and Sita
is Sivani; Thou art man, and Sita is woman. What more need I say? Thou
alone dost exist wherever there is a male, and Sita wherever there is a
female.\'</p>
<p>(To the devotees) \"One cannot renounce by the mere wish. There are
prarabdha karma-inherited tendencies-and the like. Once a yogi said to a
king, \'Live with me in the forest and think of God.\' The king replied:
\'That I cannot very well do. I could live with you, but I still have
the desire for enjoyment. If I live in this forest, perhaps I shall
create a kingdom even here. I still have desires.\'</p>
<p>\"Natabar Panja used to look after his cows in this garden during his
boyhood. He had many desires. Hence he has established a castor-oil
factory and earned a great deal of money. He has a prosperous castor-oil
business at Alambazar.</p>
<p>\"There is one sect that prescribes spiritual discipline in company with
women. I was once taken to the women belonging to the Kartabhaja sect.
They all sat around me. I addressed them as \'mother\'. At that they
whispered among themselves: \'He is still a pravartaka. He doesn\'t know
the way.\' According to that sect the pravartaka is the beginner. Then
comes the sadhaka, the struggling aspirant, and last of all the siddha
of the siddha, the supremely perfect. A woman walked over to
Vaishnavcharan and sat near him. Asked about it, he answered, \'She
feels just like a young girl.\' One quickly strays from the religious
path by looking on woman as wife: But to regard her as mother is a pure
attitude.\"</p>
<p>Some of the devotees took leave of the Master, saying that they were
going to visit the temple of Kāli and several of the other temples.</p>
<p>M. went walking alone in the Panchavati and other places in the temple
garden. He thought about the Master\'s assurance that God can be easily
realized, and about his exhortation to lead a life of intense
renunciation, and his saying that maya, when recognized, takes to
flight.</p>
<p><strong>Image worship</strong></p>
<p>At half past three in the afternoon M. again entered the Master\'s room
and sat on the floor. A teacher from the Broughton Institution had come
with several students to pay a visit to Sri Ramakrishna. They were</p>
<p>conversing together. Now and then the teacher asked questions. The
conversation was about the worship of images.</p>
<p>MASTER (to the teacher): \"What is wrong with image worship? The Vedānta
says that Brahman manifests Itself where there is \'Existence, Light,
and Love\'. Therefore nothing exists but Brahman.</p>
<p>\"How long do small girls play with their dolls? As long as they are not
married and do not live with their husbands. After marriage they put the
dolls away in a box. What further need is there of worshipping the image
after the vision of God?\"</p>
<p><strong>God-vision through yearning</strong></p>
<p>The Master glanced at M. and said: \"One attains God when one feels
yearning for Him. An intense restlessness is needed. Through it the
whole mind goes to God.</p>
<p>\"A man had a daughter who became a widow when she was very young. She
had never known her husband: She noticed the husbands of other girls and
said one day to her father, \'Where is my husband?\' The father replied:
\'Govinda is your husband. He will come to you if you call Him.\' At
these words the girl went to her room, closed the door, and cried to
Govinda, saying: \'O Govinda, corne to me! Show Yourself to me! Why
don\'t You come?\' God could not resist the girl\'s piteous cry and
appeared before her.</p>
<p>\"One must have childlike faith-and the intense yearning that a child
feels to see its mother. That yearning is like the red sky in the east
at dawn. After such a sky the sun must rise. Immediately after that
yearning one sees God.</p>
<p>\"Let me tell you the story of a boy named Jatila. He used to walk to
school through the woods, and the journey frightened him; One day he
told his mother of his fear. She replied: \'Why should you be afraid?
Call Madhusudana.\' \'Mother,\' asked the boy, \'who is Madhusudana?\'
The mother said, \'He is your Elder Brother.\' One day after this, when
the boy again felt afraid in the woods, he cried out, \'O Brother
Madhusudana!\' But there was no response. He began to weep aloud:
\'Where are You, Brother Madhusudana? Come to me. I am afraid.\' Then
God could no longer stay away. He appeared before the boy and said:
\'Here I am. Why are you frightened?\' And so, saying He took the boy
out of the woods and showed him the way to school. When He took leave of
the boy, God said: \'I will come whenever you call Me. Do not be
afraid.\' One must have this faith of a child, this yearning.</p>
<p>\"A brahmin used to worship his Family Deity daily with food offerings.
One day he had to go away on business. As he was about to leave the
house, he said to his young son: \'Give the offering to the Deity today.
See that God is fed.\' The boy offered food in the shrine, but the image
remained silent on the altar. It would neither talk nor eat. The boy
waited a long time, but still the image did not move. But the boy firmly
believed that God would come down from His throne, sit on the floor, and
partake of the food. Again and again he prayed to the Deity, saying: \'O
Lord, come down and eat the food. It is already very late. I cannot sit
here any longer.\' But the image did not utter a word. The boy burst
into tears and cried: \'O Lord, my father asked me to feed You. Why
won\'t You come down? Why won\'t You eat from my hands?\' The boy wept
for some time with a longing soul. At last the Deity, smiling, came down
from the altar and sat before the meal and ate it. After feeding the
Deity, the boy came out of the shrine room. His relatives said: \'The
worship is over. Now bring away the offering.\' \'Yes,\' said the boy,
\'the worship is over. But God has eaten everything.\' \'How is that?\'
asked the relatives. The boy replied innocently, \'Why, God has eaten
the food.\' They entered the shrine and were speechless with wonder to
see that the Deity had really eaten every bit of the offering.\"</p>
<p>Late in the afternoon Sri Ramakrishna was talking to M. They were
standing on the south side of the nahabat.</p>
<p>Since it was winter the Master was wrapped in his woolen shawl.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Where will you sleep? In the hut in the Panchavati?\"</p>
<p>M: \"Won\'t they let me have the room on the upper floor of the
nahabat?\"</p>
<p>M. selected the nahabat because he had a poetic temperament. From there
he could see the sky, the Ganges, the moonlight, and the flowers in the
garden.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Oh, they\'ll let you have it. But I suggested the Panchavati
because so much contemplation and meditation have been practised there
and the name of God has been chanted there so often.\"</p>
<p>It was evening. Incense was burning in the Master\'s room. He was
sitting on the small couch, absorbed in meditation. M. was sitting on
the floor with Rākhāl , Lātu, and Ramlal.</p>
<p><strong>Singing of devotional songs</strong></p>
<p>The Master said to M., \"The sum and substance of the whole thing is to
cultivate devotion for God and love Him.\" At Sri Ramakrishna\'s request
Ramlal sang a few songs, the Master himself singing the first line of
each.</p>
<p>Ramlal sang:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Oh, what a vision I have beheld in Keshab Bharati\'s hut!</em></p>
<p><em>Gora, in all his matchless grace,</em></p>
<p><em>Shedding tears in a thousand streams!</em></p>
<p><em>Like a mad elephant</em></p>
<p><em>He dances in ecstasy and sings,</em></p>
<p><em>Drunk with an overwhelming love. . . .</em></p>
<p><em>Then he sang:</em></p>
<p><em>Though I am never loath to grant salvation,</em></p>
<p><em>I hesitate indeed to grant pure love.</em></p>
<p><em>Whoever wins pure love surpasses all;</em></p>
<p><em>He is adored by men;</em></p>
<p><em>He triumphs over the three worlds. . . .</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna said to Ramlal, <em>"</em>Sing that one-<em>\'Gaur and Nitai, ye
blessed brothers\'</em>.<em>\"</em> Ramlal began the song and the Master joined
him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Gaur and Nitai, ye blessed brothers!</em></p>
<p><em>I have heard how kind you are,</em></p>
<p><em>And therefore I have come to you.</em></p>
<p><em>When I visited Benares,</em></p>
<p><em>Śiva, Lord of Kasi, told me</em></p>
<p><em>Of the Parabrahman\'s birth,</em></p>
<p><em>As man, in Mother Sachi\'s home.</em></p>
<p><em>O Brahman, Thee I recognize!</em></p>
<p><em>Many a sādhu have I seen,</em></p>
<p><em>But never one so kind as you.</em></p>
<p><em>Once at Braja you were born</em></p>
<p><em>As Kanai and Balai, His brother;</em></p>
<p><em>Now, once more, in Nadia,</em></p>
<p><em>As Gaur and Nitai do you appear,</em></p>
<p><em>Hiding the shapes that then you wore.</em></p>
<p><em>In Braja\'s pastures running freely,</em></p>
<p><em>Once you frolicked; now, for play,</em></p>
<p><em>You roll on the ground in Nadia,</em></p>
<p><em>Chanting aloud Lord Hari\'s name.</em></p>
<p><em>Laughing, shouting, once you played</em></p>
<p><em>At Braja with your cowherd friends;</em></p>
<p><em>And now you chant Lord Hari\'s name.</em></p>
<p><em>O Gaur, how cleverly you hide</em></p>
<p><em>The dark-blue form you wore at Braja!</em></p>
<p><em>But your slanting eyes betray you.</em></p>
<p><em>Through the blessing of your name</em></p>
<p><em>The sinner is set free, they say;</em></p>
<p><em>And so my soul is filled with hope.</em></p>
<p><em>Now with eager heart I hasten</em></p>
<p><em>To your feet: Lord! I implore you,</em></p>
<p><em>Keep me safe within their shadow.</em></p>
<p><em>You redeemed Jagai and Madhai,</em></p>
<p><em>Wretched sinners though they were;</em></p>
<p><em>I pray you, do the same for me.</em></p>
<p><em>I have heard that you embrace</em></p>
<p><em>All men as brothers, even the outcaste,</em></p>
<p><em>Whispering in the ears of all</em></p>
<p><em>Lord Hari\'s life-renewing name.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Late at night M. sat alone in the nahabat. The sky, the river, the
garden, the steeples of the temples; the trees, and the Panchavati were
flooded with moonlight. Deep silence reigned everywhere, broken only by
the melodious murmuring of the Ganges. M. was meditating on Sri
Ramakrishna.</p>
<p>At three o\'clock in the morning M. left his seat. He proceeded toward
the Panchavati as Sri Ramakrishna. had suggested. He did not care for
the nahabat any more and resolved to stay in the hut in the Panchavati.</p>
<p>Suddenly he heard a distant sound, as if someone were wailing piteously,
\"Oh, where art Thou, Brother</p>
<p>Madhusudana?\" The light of the full moon streamed through the thick
foliage of the Panchavati, and as he</p>
<p>proceeded he saw at a distance one of the Master\'s disciples sitting
alone in the grove, crying helplessly, \"Oh,</p>
<p>where art Thou, Brother Madhusudana?\"</p>
<p>Silently M. watched him.</p>
<p><strong>Saturday, December 15, 1883</strong></p>
<p><strong>Story of Prahlada</strong></p>
<p>M. had been staying at Dakshineswar with Sri Ramakrishna. The Master was
sitting in his room, listening to the life of Prahlada, which Ramlal was
reading from the Bhaktamala. M. was sitting on the floor. Rākhāl , Lātu,
and Harish were also in the room, and Hazra was on the verandah. While
listening to the story of Prahlada\'s love for God, Sri Ramakrishna went
into an ecstatic mood.</p>
<p>Hiranyakasipu, the king of the demons and father of Prahlada, had put
his son to endless torture to divert the boy\'s mind from the love of
God. But through divine grace all the king\'s attempts to kill Prahlada
were ineffective. At last God appeared, assuming the form of Nrisimha,
the Man-lion, and killed Hiranyakasipu. The gods were frightened at the
rage and roaring of the Man-lion and thought that the destruction of the
world was imminent.</p>
<p>They sent Prahlada to pacify the Deity. The boy sang a hymn to Him in
words of love, and the Man-lion, moved by affection, licked Prahlada\'s
body.</p>
<p>Still in an ecstatic mood, the Master said, \"Ah! Ah! What love for the
devotee!\" The Master went into deep samādhi. He sat there motionless. A
tear-drop could be seen at the corner of each of his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>Master admonishes M.</strong></p>
<p>The Master came down to the plane of the sense world and spoke to M.,
expressing his abhorrence for those</p>
<p>who, while practising spiritual discipline, enjoyed sex-life.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Aren\'t you ashamed of yourself? You have children, and still
you enjoy intercourse with your wife. Don\'t you hate yourself for thus
leading an animal life? Don\'t you hate yourself for dallying with a
body which contains only blood, phlegm, filth, and excreta? He who
contemplates the Lotus Feet of God looks on even the most beautiful
woman as mere ash from the cremation ground. To enjoy a body which will
not last and which consists of such impure ingredients as intestines,
bile, flesh, and bone! Aren\'t you ashamed of yourself?\"</p>
<p>M. sat there silently, hanging his head in shame.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"A man who has tasted even a drop of God\'s ecstatic love looks
on \'woman and gold\' as most insignificant. He who has tasted syrup
made from sugar candy regards a drink made from treacle as a mere
trifle. One gradually obtains that love for God if one but prays to Him
with a yearning heart and always chants His name and glories.\"</p>
<p>The Master was in an ecstasy of love. He began to dance about the room
and sing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Who is singing Hari\'s name upon the sacred Ganges\' bank?</em></p>
<p><em>Is it Nitai that has come, the giver of heavenly love? .</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was ten o\'clock in the morning. Ramlal had finished the daily
worship in the Kāli temple. The Master went to the temple accompanied by
M. Entering the shrine, the Master sat before the image. He offered a
flower or two at the feet of the Divine Mother. Then he put a flower on
his own head and began to meditate. He sang a song to the Divine Mother:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Thy name, I have heard, O Consort of Śiva, is the destroyer of our
fear,</em></p>
<p><em>And so on Thee I cast my burden: Save me! Save me, O kindly Mother!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna returned from the Kāli temple and sat on the southeast
verandah of his room. He ate some refreshments which had been offered at
the temple, and the devotees also received a share.</p>
<p>Rākhāl sat by the Master and read about Lord Erskine from Self-Help by
Smiles.</p>
<p>MASTER (to M.): \"What does the book say?\"</p>
<p>M: \"It says that Lord Erskine performed his duty without desiring any
result for himself. Disinterested duty.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"That is very good. But the characteristic of a man of Perfect
Knowledge is that he doesn\'t keep a single book with him. He carries
all his Knowledge on the tip of his tongue. There\'s the instance of
Sukadeva. Books-I mean the scriptures-contain a mixture of sand and
sugar. The sādhu takes the sugar, leaving aside the sand. He takes only
the essence.\"</p>
<p>Vaishnavcharan, the musician, arrived and sang a few devotional songs.</p>
<p>M. spent the night in the nahabat.</p>
<p><strong>Sunday, December 16, 1883</strong></p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna was seated with M. on the semicircular porch of his room
at about ten o\'clock in the morning. The fragrance of gardenias,
jasmines, oleanders, roses, and other flowers filled the air. The Master
was singing looking at M:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Thou must save me, sweetest Mother! Unto Thee I come for refuge,</em></p>
<p><em>Helpless as a bird imprisoned in a cage.</em></p>
<p><em>I have done unnumbered wrongs, and aimlessly I roam about,</em></p>
<p><em>Misled by maya\'s spell, bereft of wisdom\'s light,</em></p>
<p><em>Comfortless as a mother cow whose calf has wandered far away.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>MASTER: \"But why? Why should I live like a \'bird imprisoned in a
cage\'? Fie! For shame!\"</p>
<p>As the Master said these words he went into an ecstatic mood. His body
became motionless and his mind stopped functioning; tears streamed down
his cheeks. After a while he said, \"O Mother, make me like Sita,
completely forgetful of everything-body and limbs-, totally unconscious
of hands, feet, and sense-organs-only the one thought in her mind,
\'Where is Rāma?\' \"</p>
<p>Was the Master inspired by the ideal of Sita to teach M. the yearning
that a devotee should feel for God? Sita\'s very life was centred in
Rāma. Completely absorbed in the thought of Rāma, Sita forgot even the
body, which is so dear to all.</p>
<p>At four o\'clock in the afternoon Mr. Mukherji, a relative of
Prankrishna, arrived in the company of a brahmin well versed in the
scriptures.</p>
<p>MUKHERJI: \"I am very happy to meet you, sir.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"God dwells in all beings. He is the gold in all. In some
places it is more clearly manifest than in others. God dwells in the
worldly-minded, no doubt, but He is hidden there, like gold under deep
layers of clay.\"</p>
<p>MUKHERJI: \"Sir, what is the difference between worldly and
other-worldly things?\"</p>
<p><strong>Brahman and the world</strong></p>
<p>MASTER: \"While striving for the realization of God, the aspirant has to
practise renunciation, applying the logic of \'Neti, neti\'-\'Not this,
not this\', But after attaining the vision of God, he realizes that God
alone has become all things.</p>
<p>\"At one time Rāma was overpowered by the spirit of renunciation.
Dasaratha, worried at this, went to the sageVasishtha and begged him to
persuade Rāma not to give up the world. The sage came to Rāma and found
him in a gloomy mood. The fire of intense renunciation had been raging
in the Prince\'s mind. Vasishtha said: \'Rāma, why should You renounce
the world? Is the world outside God? Reason with me.\' Rāma realized
that the world had evolved from the Supreme Brahman. So, He said
nothing.</p>
<p>\"Buttermilk is made from the same substance as butter. One who realizes
this knows that butter goes with buttermilk and buttermilk with butter.
After separating the butter with great effort-that is to say, after
attaining Brahmajnana-you will realize that as long as butter exists,
buttermilk also must exist. Wherever there is butter there must be
buttermilk as well. As long as one feels that Brahman exists, one must
also be aware that the universe, living beings, and the twenty-four
cosmic principles exist as well.</p>
<p><strong>Nature of Brahman</strong></p>
<p>\"What Brahman is cannot be described in words. Everything has been
polluted, like food that has touched the tongue-that is, everything has
been described in words. But no one has been able to describe Brahman.
It is therefore unpolluted. I said this to Vidyasagar and he was
delighted.</p>
<p>\"But the Knowledge of Brahman cannot be realized if the aspirant is
worldly-minded even in the slightest degree. He succeeds in acquiring
this Knowledge only when his mind is totally free from \'woman and
gold\'. Parvati once said to Her father, \'Father, seek the company of
holy men if you want the Knowledge of Brahman.\' \"</p>
<p>Addressing Mr. Mukherji, Sri Ramakrishna said: \"You are rich, and still
you call on God. That is very good indeed. It is said in the Gitā that
those who fall from the path of yoga are born in their next birth as
devotees of God in rich families.\"</p>
<p>Mr. Mukherji quoted the line from the Gitā.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"God, if He so desires, can keep a Jnāni in the world too. The
world and all living beings have been created by His will. But He is
self-willed.\"</p>
<p>MUKHERJI (with a smile): \"How can God have any will? Does He lack
anything?\"</p>
<p>MASTER (with a smile): \"What\'s wrong in that? Water is water whether
it is still or in waves. The snake is a snake whether it is coiled up
motionless or wriggles along. A man is the same man whether sitting
still or engaged in action.</p>
<p>\"How can you eliminate from the Reality the universe and its living
beings? If you do that, It will lack Its full weight. You cannot find
out the total weight of the bel-fruit if you eliminate the seeds and
shell.</p>
<p>\"Brahman is unattached. One finds good and bad smells in the air, but
the air itself is untainted. Brahman and Śakti are identical. It is the
Primordial Power that has become the world and all living beings.\"</p>
<p>MUKHERJI: \"Why does one deviate from the path of yoga?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"As the saying goes: \'In my mother\'s womb I was in a state of
yoga; coming into the world, I have eaten its clay. The midwife has cut
one shackle, the navel cord; but how shall I cut the shackle of maya?\'</p>
<p><strong>\"Woman and gold\"</strong></p>
<p>\"Maya is nothing but \'woman\' and \'gold\'. A man attains yoga when he
has freed his mind from these two. The Self-the Supreme Self-is the
magnet; the individual self is the needle. The individual self
experiences the state of yoga when it is attracted by the Supreme Self
to Itself. But the magnet cannot attract the needle if the needle is
covered with clay; it can draw the needle only when the clay is removed.
The clay of \'woman\' and \'gold\' must be removed.\"</p>
<p>MUKHERJI: \"How can one remove it?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Weep for God with a longing heart. Tears shed for Him will
wash away the clay. When you have thus freed yourself from impurity, you
will be attracted by the magnet. Only then will you attain yoga.\"</p>
<p>MUKHERJI: \"Priceless words!\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"If a man is able to weep for God, he will see Him. He will go
into samādhi. Perfection in yoga is samādhi. A man achieves kumbhaka
without any yogic exercise if he but weeps for God. The next stage is
samādhi.</p>
<p>\"There is another method -that of meditation. In the Sahasrara, Śiva
manifests Himself in a special manner. The aspirant should meditate on
Him. The body is like a tray; the mind and buddhi are like water. The
Sun of Satchidananda is reflected in this water. Meditating on the
reflected sun, one sees the Real Sun through the grace of God.</p>
<p>\"But the worldly man must constantly live in the company of holy men.
It is necessary for all, even for sannyasis. But it is especially
necessary for the householder. His disease has become chronic because he
has to live constantly in the midst of \'woman and gold\'.\"</p>
<p>MUKHERJI: \"Yes, sir. The disease has indeed become chronic\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Give God the power of attorney. Let Him do whatever He wants.
Be like a kitten and cry to Him with a fervent heart. The mother cat
puts the kitten wherever she wants to. The kitten doesn\'t know
anything. It is left sometimes on the bed and sometimes near the
hearth.\"</p>
<p>MUKHERJI: \"It is good to read sacred books like the Gitā.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"But what will you gain by mere reading? Some have heard of
milk, some have seen it, and there are some, besides, who have drunk it.
God can indeed be seen; what is more, one can talk to Him.</p>
<p><strong>Different stages of spiritual progress</strong></p>
<p>\"The first stage is that of the beginner. He studies and hears. Second
is the stage of the struggling aspirant. He prays to God, meditates on
Him, and sings His name and glories. The third stage is that of the
perfect soul. He has seen God, realized Him directly and immediately in
his inner Consciousness. Last is the stage of the supremely perfect,
like Chaitanya. Such a devotee establishes a definite relationship with
God, looking on Him as his Son or Beloved.\"</p>
<p>M., Rākhāl , Jogin, Lātu, and the other devotees were entranced by these
words of divine realization.</p>
<p>Mr. Mukherji and his friend were taking leave of the Master. After
saluting him, they stood up. The Master also stood up to show them
courtesy.</p>
<p>MUKHERJI (smiling): \"That you should stand up or sit down!\"</p>
<p>MASTER (smiling): \"But what\'s the harm? Water is water whether it is
placid or in waves. I am like a cast-off leaf in the wind. The wind
blows that leaf wherever it lists. I am the machine and God is its
Operator.\"</p>
<p>Mr. Mukherji and his friend left the room. M. thought: \"According to
the Vedānta all is like a dream. Are all these-the ego, the universe,
and the living beings-unreal then?\"</p>
<p>M. had studied a little of the Vedānta. He also had read the German
philosophers, such as Kant and Hegel, whose writings are only a faint
echo of the Vedānta. But Sri Ramakrishna did not arrive at his
conclusions by reasoning, as do ordinary scholars. It was the Divine
Mother of the Universe who revealed the Truth to him. These were the
thoughts that passed through M.\'s mind.</p>
<p>A little later Sri Ramakrishna and M. were conversing on the porch west
of the Master\'s room. No one else was there. It was a late winter
afternoon, and the sun had not yet gone below the horizon.</p>
<p><strong>Is the world unreal?</strong></p>
<p>M: \"Is the world unreal?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Why should it be unreal? What you are asking is a matter for
philosophical discussion.</p>
<p>\"In the beginning, when a man reasons following the Vedantic method of
\'Not this, not this\', he realizes that Brahman is not the living
beings, not the universe, not the twenty-four cosmic principles. All
these things become like dreams to him. Then comes the affirmation of
what has been denied, and he feels that God Himself has become the
universe and all living beings.</p>
<p>\"Suppose you are climbing to the roof by the stairs. As long as you are
aware of the roof, you are also aware of the stairs. He who is aware of
the high is also aware of the low. But after reaching the roof you
realize that the stairs are made of the same materials-brick, lime, and
brick-dust-as the roof.</p>
<p>\"Further, I have given the illustration of the bel-fruit. Both
changeability and unchangeability belong to one and the same Reality.</p>
<p>\"The ego cannot be done away with. As long as \'I-consciousness\'
exists, living beings and the universe must also exist. After realizing
God, one sees that, it is He Himself who has become the universe and the
living beings. But one cannot realize this by mere reasoning.</p>
<p>\"Śiva has two states of mind. First, the state of samādhi, when He is
transfixed in the Great Yoga. He is then</p>
<p>Ātmārāma, satisfied in the Self. Second, the state when He descends from
samādhi and keeps a trace of ego. Then He dances about, chanting,
\'Rāma, Rāma!\'\"</p>
<p>Did the Master describe Śiva to hint at his own state of mind?</p>
<p>It was evening. Sri Ramakrishna was meditating on the Divine Mother and
chanting Her holy name. The devotees also went off to solitary places
and meditate on their Chosen Ideals. Evening worship began at the temple
garden in the shrines of Kāli, Radha-Krishna, and Śiva.</p>
<p>It was the second day of the dark fortnight of the moon. Soon the moon
rose in the sky, bathing temples, trees, flowers, and the rippling
surface of the Ganges in its light. The Master was sitting on the couch
and M. on the floor. The conversation turned to the Vedānta.</p>
<p>MASTER (to M.): \"Why should the universe be unreal? That is a
speculation of the philosophers. After realizing God, one sees that it
is God Himself who has become the universe and all living beings.</p>
<p><strong>Divine Mother is the Universal Consciousness</strong></p>
<p>\"The Divine Mother revealed to me in the Kāli temple that it was She
who had become everything. She showed me that everything was full of
Consciousness. The Image was Consciousness, the altar was Consciousness,
the water-vessels were Consciousness, the door-sill was Consciousness,
the marble floor was Consciousness-all was Consciousness.</p>
<p>\"I found everything inside the room soaked, as it were, in Bliss-the
Bliss of Satchidananda. I saw a wicked man in front of the Kāli temple;
but in him also I saw the Power of the Divine Mother vibrating.</p>
<p>\"That was why I fed a cat with the food that was to be offered to the
Divine Mother. I clearly perceived that the Divine Mother Herself had
become everything-even the cat. The manager of the temple garden wrote
to Mathur Babu saying that I was feeding the cat with the offering
intended for the Divine Mother. But Mathur Babu had insight into the
state of my mind. He wrote back to the manager: \'Let him do whatever he
likes. You must not say anything to him.\'</p>
<p>\"After realizing God, one sees all this aright-that it is He who has
become the universe, living beings, and the twenty-four cosmic
principles. But what remains when God completely effaces the ego cannot
be described in words. As Ramprasad said in one of his songs, \'Then
alone will you know whether you are good or I am good!\' I get into even
that state now and then.</p>
<p>\"A man sees a thing in one way through reasoning and in an altogether
different way when God Himself shows it to him.\"</p>
<p><strong>Monday, December 17, 1883</strong></p>
<p>It was about eight o\'clock in the morning. Sri Ramakrishna was in his
room with M., when Dr. Madhu arrived and sat down beside the Master on
the small couch. He was an elderly man and full of wit. He used to visit
the Master when the latter felt indisposed.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"The whole thing, in a nutshell is that one must develop
ecstatic love for Satchidananda. What kind of love? How should one love
God? Gauri used to say that one must become like Sita to understand
Rāma; like Bhagavati, the Divine Mother, to understand Bhagavan, Śiva.
One must practise austerity, as Bhagavati did, in order to attain Śiva.
One must cultivate the attitude of Prakriti in order to realize
Purusha-the attitude of a friend, a handmaid, or a mother.</p>
<p>\"I saw Sita in a vision. I found that her entire mind was concentrated
on Rāma. She was totally indifferent to everything-her hands, her feet,
her clothes, her jewels. It seemed that Rāma had filled every bit of her
life and she could not remain alive without Rāma.\"</p>
<p>M: \"Yes, sir. She was mad with love for Rāma.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Mad! That\'s the word. One must become mad with love in order
to realize God. But that love is not possible if the mind dwells on
\'woman and gold\'. Sex-life with a woman! What happiness is there in
that? The realization of God gives ten million times more happiness.
Gauri used to say that when a man attains ecstatic love of God all the
pores of the skin, even the roots of the hair, become like so many
sexual organs, and in every pore the aspirant enjoys the happiness of
communion with the Ātman.</p>
<p>\"One must call on God with a longing heart. One must learn from the
guru how God can be realized. Only if the guru himself has attained
Perfect Knowledge can he show the way.</p>
<p>\"A man, gets rid of all desires when he has Perfect Knowledge. He
becomes like a child five years old. Sages like Dattatreya and
Jadabharata had the nature of a child.\"</p>
<p>M: \"One hears about them. But there were many others like them that the
world doesn\'t hear about.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Yes. The Jnāni gets rid of all desire if any is left, it does
not hurt him. At the touch of the philosopher\'s stone the sword is
transformed into gold. Then that sword cannot do any killing. Just so,
the Jnāni keeps only a semblance of anger and passion. They are anger
and passion only in name and cannot injure him.\"</p>
<ol>
<li>\"Yes, sir. The Jnāni goes beyond the three gunas, as you say. He is
    not under the control of any of the gunas-sattva, rajas, or tamas.
    All these three are so many robbers, as it were.\"</li>
</ol>
<p>MASTER: \"Yes, one must assimilate that.\"</p>
<p>M: \"In this world there are perhaps not more than three or four men of
Perfect Knowledge.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Why do you say that? One sees many holy men and sannyasis in
the monasteries of upper India.\"</p>
<p>M: \"Well, I too can become a sannyasi like one of those.\"</p>
<p>The Master fixed his gaze on M. and said, \"By renouncing everything?\"</p>
<ol>
<li>\"What can a man achieve unless he gets rid of maya? What will a man
    gain by merely being a sannyasi, if he cannot subdue maya?\"</li>
</ol>
<p>Both remained silent a few minutes.</p>
<p>M: \"Sir, what is the nature of the divine love transcending the three
gunas?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Attaining that love, the devotee sees everything full of
Spirit and Consciousness. To him \'Krishna is Consciousness, and His
sacred Abode is also Consciousness\'. The devotee, too, is
Consciousness. Everything is Consciousness. Very few people attain such
love.\"</p>
<p>DR. MADHU: \"The love transcending the three gunas means, in other
words, that the devotee is not under the control of any of the gunas.\"</p>
<p>MASTER (smiling): \"Yes, that\'s it. He becomes like a child five years
old, not under the control of any of the gunas.\"</p>
<p>The Master was resting after his noon meal. Mani Mallick arrived and
saluted him. Sri Ramakrishna remained lying on the couch and said a word
or two to Mani.</p>
<p>MANI: \"I hear you visited Keshab Sen.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Yes. How is he now?\"</p>
<p>MANI: \"He hasn\'t recovered to any extent from his illness.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"I found him to be very rajasic. I had to wait a long time
before I could see him.\"</p>
<p>The Master sat up on the couch and continued his conversation with the
devotees.</p>
<p>MASTER (to M.): \"I became mad for Rāma. I used to walk about carrying
an image of Ramlala given to me by a monk. I bathed it, fed it, and laid
it down to sleep. I carried it wherever I went. I became mad for
Ramlala.\"</p>
