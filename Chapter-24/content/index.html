<p>FESTIVAL AT SURENDRA\'S HOUSE</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sunday, June 15, 1884</p>
</blockquote>
<p>SRI RAMAKRISHNA arrived in the morning at the garden house of Surendra,
one of his beloved householder disciples, in the village of Kankurgachi
near Calcutta. Surendra had invited him and a large number of the
devotees to a religious festival.</p>
<p>Occasions like this were a source of great happiness and rejoicing to
the Master\'s devotees. He was then seen at his best. He joined with the
others in devotional music and in chanting the names of God, frequently
going into ecstasy. He poured out his entire soul in inspired talk,
explaining the various phases of God-Consciousness. The impressions of
such a festival lingered in the minds of all for many days.</p>
<p>The devotees stood in rows inside the big hall of the garden house to
hear the music sung by the professional singers. The floor of the room
was covered with a carpet over which was spread a white sheet; a few
bolsters, pillows, and cushions lay here and there.</p>
<p><strong>Krishna and Gopis at Vrindāvan</strong></p>
<p>The musicians were singing of the episodes in the life of Sri Krishna
especially associated with His divine love for the gopis of Vrindāvan.
This was a theme which always appealed to the Master and would throw him
into ecstatic moods.</p>
<p>Krishna, God Incarnate, lived the years of His boyhood in Vrindāvan as a
cowherd. He tended His cows on the green meadows along the bank of the
Jamuna and played His flute. The milkmaids could not resist the force of
His divine attraction. At the sound of His flute they would leave their
household duties and go to the bank of the sacred river. Their love for
Krishna destroyed their attachment to worldly things. Neither the
threats of their relatives nor the criticism of others could make them
desist from seeking the company of Krishna. In the love of the gopis for
Krishna there was not the slightest trace of worldliness. It was the
innate attraction of God for pure souls, as of the magnet for iron. The
author of the Bhagavata has compared this love to the all-consuming love
of a woman for her beloved. Before the on rush of that love all barriers
between man and God are swept away. The devotee surrenders himself
completely to his Divine Beloved and in the end becomes one with Him.</p>
<p>Radha was the foremost of the gopis, and Krishna\'s chief playmate. She
felt an indescribable longing for union with Him. A moment\'s separation
from Krishna would rend her heart and soul.</p>
<p>During many a moonlit night Krishna would dance with Radha and the gopis
in the sacred groves of Vrindāvan, and on such occasions the gopis would
experience the highest religious ecstasy. At the age of eleven Krishna
was called to be the king of Mathura. He left the gopis, promising them,
however, His divine vision whenever they concentrated on Him in their
hearts.</p>
<p>For centuries and centuries the lovers of God in 1ndia have been
worshipping the Divine by recreating in themselves the yearning of the
gopis for Krishna. Many of the folk-songs of India have as their theme
this sweet episode of Krishna\'s life. Sri Chaitanya revived this phase
of Hindu religious life by his spiritual practice and his divine
visions. In his ecstatic music Chaitanya assumed the role of Radha and
manifested the longing to be united with Krishna. For a long period Sri
Ramakrishna also worshipped God as his beloved Krishna, looking on
himself as one of the gopis or as God\'s handmaid.</p>
<p>At Surendra\'s garden house the kirtan had begun early in the morning.
The musicians were singing about the love of Krishna and Radha for each
other. The Master was frequently in samādhi. The room was crowded with
devotees, among them Bhavanath, Niranjan, Rākhāl , Surendra, Ram, and
M., and many members of the</p>
<p>Brahmo Samaj.</p>
<p>In accordance with the custom, the kirtan had begun with, an
introductory song about Gaurānga.</p>
<p>Gaurānga embraces monastic life. He is being consumed with longing for a
vision of Krishna. He leaves Navadvip and goes away as a wandering monk
to seek out his Beloved. His devotees, unable to bear the pangs of
separation, weep bitterly and beg Gaurānga to return.</p>
<p>The musician sang:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>對</em> <em>O Gaur, come back to Nadia!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Master\'s ecstasy</strong></p>
<p>Next the musician sang about the anguish of Radha at her separation from
Krishna. When Sri Ramakrishna heard the song he suddenly stood up.
Assuming the mood of Radha, he sang in a voice laden with sorrow,
improvising the words: \"O friend, either bring my beloved Krishna here
or take me to Him.\" Thus singing, he completely lost himself in Radha
and could not continue the song. He became speechless, his body
motionless, his eyes half closed, his mind totally unconscious of the
outer world. He was in deep samādhi.</p>
<p><strong>Radha\'s anguish at separation from Krishna</strong></p>
<p>After a long time he regained normal consciousness and said in the same
heart-rending voice: \"O friend, take me to my beloved Krishna and make
me your bondslave. I shall be your handmaid for ever. O friend, it was
you who taught me how to love Krishna. O Krishna! O Beloved of my
soul!\"</p>
<p>The professional musicians continued their song. They took the part of
Radha and sang as if she were talking</p>
<p>to her friend: <em>\"O friend, I shall not go again to the Jamuna to draw
water. Once I beheld my beloved Friend under the kadamba tree. Whenever
I pass it I am overwhelmed.\"</em></p>
<p>The Master again became abstracted. Heaving a deep sigh he said, \"Ah
me! Ah me!\"</p>
<p>The song went on. Radha says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Even the desire for Krishna\'s presence</em></p>
<p><em>Has cooled and refreshed my feverish body.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now and then, the musicians improvised lines to the music, continuing in
the attitude of Radha:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>\"O friends, you can wait. Show me Krishna, my Beloved.\"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again: <em>\"Do not bother about my ornaments. I have lost my most precious
Ornament.\"</em></p>
<p>And again: <em>\"Alas! I have fallen on evil days. My happy days are
over.\"</em> And finally: <em>\"This unhappy time lingers so long!\"</em></p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna improvised a line himself: <em>\"Are not better times yet
in sight for me?\"</em> The musicians then</p>
<p>improvised: <em>\"Such a long time has passed! Are not better times yet in
sight for me?\"</em></p>
<p>The musicians sang Radha\'s words to a friend:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>O friend, I am dying! Surely I die.</em></p>
<p><em>The anguish of being kept apart</em></p>
<p><em>From Krishna is more than I can bear.</em></p>
<p><em>Alas! to whom then shall I leave.</em></p>
<p><em>My priceless Treasure? When I am dead,</em></p>
<p><em>I beg you, do not burn my body;</em></p>
<p><em>Do not cast it into the river.</em></p>
<p><em>See that it is not given to the flames;</em></p>
<p><em>Do not cast it into the water.</em></p>
<p><em>In this body I played with Krishna.</em></p>
<p><em>Bind my lifeless form, I beg you,</em></p>
<p><em>To the black tamala\'s branches;</em></p>
<p><em>Tie it to the tamala tree.</em></p>
<p><em>Touching tamala it touches black.</em></p>
<p><em>Krishna is black, and black is tamala;</em></p>
<p><em>Black is the colour that I love.</em></p>
<p><em>From earliest childhood I have loved it.</em></p>
<p><em>To the black Krishna my body belongs;</em></p>
<p><em>Let it not lie apart from black!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Radha reaches her last extremity. She faints away.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Radha has fallen to the ground;</em></p>
<p><em>She lies there lost to outward sense,</em></p>
<p><em>Repeating her precious Krishna\'s name,</em></p>
<p><em>And straightway doses both her eyes.</em></p>
<p><em>Ah, has the drama reached its end?</em></p>
<p><em>What ails you, O delight of Krishna?</em></p>
<p><em>Only a moment ago you spoke.</em></p>
<p><em>Her friends, anointing Radha\'s form</em></p>
<p><em>With cool and soothing sandal-paste,</em></p>
<p><em>Attempt to bring her back to earth.</em></p>
<p><em>Some of them weep in bitter grief;</em></p>
<p><em>They cannot bear to see her die.</em></p>
<p><em>Some sprinkle water on her face;</em></p>
<p><em>Perhaps she will revive again!</em></p>
<p><em>But, oh, can water give back life</em></p>
<p><em>To one who dies of Krishna\'s love?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Radha\'s friends chant Krishna\'s sweet name in her ears. This brings
her back to partial consciousness. She looks at the black tamala tree
and thinks that Krishna stands before her.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Krishna\'s name restores her life;</em></p>
<p><em>Once more her two eyes gaze around,</em></p>
<p><em>But Krishna\'s face she cannot see.</em></p>
<p><em>Alas, how bitterly she weeps!</em></p>
<p><em>\"Where is my Krishna? Where is He</em></p>
<p><em>Whose name you chanted in my ears?</em></p>
<p><em>Bring Him but once before me here!\"</em></p>
<p><em>Seeing the black tamala tree,</em></p>
<p><em>She stares at it and cries aloud:</em></p>
<p><em>\"There is His crest! I see it clearly!</em></p>
<p><em>There is my \"Krishna\'s lovely crest!\"</em></p>
<p><em>But only a peacock did she see,</em></p>
<p><em>Whose glistening feathers she mistook</em></p>
<p><em>For the gay feather on Krishna\'s crest.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Krishna has gone to Mathura to assume His royal duties. He has discarded
His cowherd\'s dress and flute and put on the royal regalia. Radha\'s
friends, after a hurried consultation, send a gopi to Mathura as
messenger. She meets a woman of that city, of her own age, who asks her
where she comes from.</p>
<p>Radha\'s friend says: \"I don\'t have to call Krishna. He Himself will
come to me.\" But none the less, she follows the woman of Mathura and
goes to Krishna\'s palace. In the street she weeps overcome with grief,
and prays to Krishna: \"O Hari, where are You? O Life of the gopis! O
Enchanter of our hearts! O Beloved of Radha! O Hari, Remover of Your
devotees\' shame! Come to us once more! With great pride I said to the
people of Mathura that You Yourself would come to me. Please do not
humiliate me.\"</p>
<p>In scorn says the woman of Mathura:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>\"Oh, you are only a simple milkmaid!</em></p>
<p><em>How can you go to see our King,</em></p>
<p><em>Our Krishna, in your beggar\'s rags?</em></p>
<p><em>Behind seven doors His chamber stands.</em></p>
<p><em>You cannot enter. How can you go?</em></p>
<p><em>I die of shame to see your boldness.</em></p>
<p><em>Tell me, how will you manage to enter?\"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Says the gopi:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>\"Krishna! Beloved!</em></p>
<p><em>Soul of the gopis! Oh, where are You?</em></p>
<p><em>Come to me here and save my life.</em></p>
<p><em>Where are You, adorable Soul of the gopis?</em></p>
<p><em>Come to me, Lord of Mathura!</em></p>
<p><em>And save the life of Your sorrowing handmaid.</em></p>
<p><em>Ah, where are You, Beloved of Radha?</em></p>
<p><em>Lord of our hearts and Friend of our souls!</em></p>
<p><em>O Hari, Destroyer of our shame!</em></p>
<p><em>O priceless Treasure of the gopis!</em></p>
<p><em>Come to Your handmaid and save her honour.\"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus the messenger weeps and cries out for Krishna.</p>
<p>When the musicians sang, <em>\"Where are You, adorable Soul of the
gopis?\"</em> the Master went into samādhi. As the music neared its end the
musicians sang louder. Sri Ramakrishna was on his feet, again in deep
samādhi. Regaining partial consciousness, he said in a half articulate
voice, \"Kitna! Kitna!\" He was too much overwhelmed to utter Krishna\'s
name distinctly.</p>
<p>The kirtan was coming to a close. At the reunion of Radha and Krishna
the Master sang with the musicians, composing the lines himself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Behold, there Radha stands by Krishna;</em></p>
<p><em>On His bosom she reclines.</em></p>
<p><em>Behold her standing at His left,</em></p>
<p><em>Like a golden creeper twining</em></p>
<p><em>Round a black tamala tree!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the music came to a close the Master led the chorus. All chanted
together, to the accompaniment of drums and cymbals: \"Victory to Radha
and Krishna! Hallowed be the names of Radha and Krishna!\" The devotees
felt a surge of divine emotion and danced around the Master. He too
danced in an ecstasy of joy. The names of God echoed and reechoed in the
house and garden.</p>
<p><strong>Master\'s praise of Niranjan</strong></p>
<p>After the music the Master sat with the devotees. Just then Niranjan
arrived and prostrated himself before him.</p>
<p>At the very sight of this beloved disciple the Master stood up; with
beaming eyes and smiling face, and said:</p>
<p>\"You have come too! (To M.) You see, this boy is absolutely guileless.
One cannot be guileless without a great deal of spiritual discipline in
previous births. A hypocritical and calculating mind can never attain
God.</p>
<p>\"Don\'t you see that God incarnates Himself only in a family where
innocence exists? How guileless Dasaratha was! So was Nanda, Krishna\'s
father. There is a saying: \'Ah, how innocent a man he is!</p>
<p>He is just like Nanda.\'</p>
<p>(To Niranjan) \"I feel as if a dark veil has covered your face. It is
because you have accepted a job in an office. One must keep accounts
there. Besides, one must attend to many other things, and that always
keeps the mind in a state of worry. You are serving in an office like
other worldly people; but there is a slight difference, in that you are
earning money for the sake of your mother. One must show the highest
respect to one\'s mother, for she is the very embodiment of the Blissful
Mother of the Universe. If you had accepted the job for the sake of wife
and children, I should have said: \'Fie upon you! Shame! A thousand
shames!\'</p>
<p>(To Mani Mallick, pointing to Niranjan) \"Look at this boy. He is
absolutely guileless. But he has one fault: he is slightly untruthful
nowadays. The other day he said that he would visit me again very soon,
but he didn\'t come. (To Niranjan) That is why Rākhāl asked you why you
didn\'t come to see me while you were at Ariadaha, so near
Dakshineswar.\"</p>
<p>NIRANJAN: \"I was there only a couple of days.\"</p>
<p>MASTER (to Niranjan, pointing to M.) \"He is the headmaster of a school.
At my bidding he went to see you. (To M.) Did you send Baburam to me the
other day?\"</p>
<p>The Master went to an adjoining room and began to talk with some
devotees there.</p>
<p><strong>Be mad for God alone</strong></p>
<p>MASTER (to M.): \"Ah! How wonderful was the yearning of the gopis for
Krishna! They were seized with divine madness at the very sight of the
black tamala tree. Separation from Krishna created such a fire of
anguish in Radha\'s heart that it dried up even the tears in her eyes!
Her tears would disappear in steam. There were other times when nobody
could notice the depth of her feeling. People do not notice the plunge
of an elephant in a big lake.\"</p>
<ol>
<li>\"Yes, sir, that is true. Chaitanya, too, experienced a similar
    feeling. He mistook a forest for the sacred grove of Vrindāvan, and
    the dark water of the ocean for the blue Jamuna\"</li>
</ol>
<p>MASTER: \"Ah! If anyone has but a particle of such prema! What yearning!
What love! Radha possessed not only one hundred per cent of divine love,
but one hundred and twenty-five per cent.</p>
<p>This is what it means to be intoxicated with ecstatic love of God. The
sum and substance of the whole matter is that a man must love God, must
be restless for Him. It doesn\'t matter whether you believe in God with
form or in God without form. You may or may not believe that God
incarnates Himself as man. But you will realize Him if you have that
yearning. Then He Himself will let you know what He is like. If you must
be mad, why should you be mad for the things of the world? If you must
be mad, be mad for God alone.\"</p>
<p>Presently Sri Ramakrishna returned to the main hall of the house. A big
pillow was placed near him for his use. Before touching it he said, \"Om
Tat Sat\" Perhaps the pillow had been used by many worldly people, and
that was why he purified it in this way. Bhavanath, M., and other
devotees sat near him. It was getting late, but there was no indication
that the meal was going to be served. The Master became impatient, like
a child, and said: \"I don\'t see any sign of food.</p>
<p>What\'s the matter? Where is Narendra?\"</p>
<p>A DEVOTEE (with a smile): \"Sir, Ram Babu is the manager of the feast.
He is superintending everything.\"</p>
<p>MASTER (laughing): \"Oh, Ram is the manager! Then we know what to
expect.\"</p>
<p>A DEVOTEE: \"Things like this always happen when he is the supervisor.\"
(All laugh.)</p>
<p>MASTER (to the devotees): \"Where is Surendra? What a nice disposition
he has now! He is very outspoken; he isn\'t afraid to speak the truth.
He is unstinting in his liberality. No one that goes to him for help
comes away empty-handed. (To M.) You went to Bhagavan Das. What sort of
man is he?\"</p>
<ol>
<li>\"He is very old now. I saw him at Kalna. It was night. He lay on a
    carpet and a devotee fed him with food that had been offered to God.
    He can hear only if one speaks loudly into his ear.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hearing me mention your name he said, \'You have nothing to worry
about.\'\"</p>
<p>BHAVANATH (to M.): \"You haven\'t been to Dakshineswar for a long time.
The Master asked me about you and said one day, \'Has M. lost all taste
for this place?\' \"</p>
<p>Bhavanath laughed as he said these words. The Master heard their
conversation and said to M. in a loving voice: \"Yes, that is true. Why
haven\'t you been to Dakshineswar for such a long time?\"</p>
<p>M. could only stammer some lame excuses.</p>
<p>Just then Mahimacharan arrived. He lived at Cossipore near Calcutta.
Mahimacharan held the Master in great respect and was a frequent visitor
at the temple garden. He was a man of independent means, having
inherited some ancestral property. He devoted his time to religious
thought and to the study of the scriptures. He was a man of some
scholarship, having studied many books, both Sanskrit and English.</p>
<p>MASTER (to Mahima): \"What is this? I see a steamship here. (All laugh.)
We expect here a small boat at the most, but a real steamship has
arrived. But then I know. It\'s the rainy season!\" (Laughter.)</p>
<p>The Master was conversing with Mahimacharan. He asked him: \"Isn\'t
feeding people a kind of service to God? God exists in all beings as
fire. To feed people is to offer oblations to that Indwelling Spirit.
But then one shouldn\'t feed the wicked, I mean people who are entangled
in gross worldliness or who have committed heinous crimes like adultery.
Even the ground where such people sit becomes impure to a depth of seven
cubits. Once Hriday fed a number of people at his native place. A good
many of them were wicked. I said to Hriday: \'Look here. If you feed
such people I shall leave your house at once.\' (To Mahima) I hear that
you used to feed people; but now you don\'t give any such feasts. Is it
because your expenses have gone up?\" (Laughter.)</p>
<p>The meal was to be served on the south verandah of the house.
Leaf-plates were being placed on the floor. The Master said to
Mahimacharan: \"Please go there and see what they are doing. You may
help them a little in serving the food. But I shouldn\'t ask you.\"
Mahimacharan said: \"Let them bring in the food. I shall see.\" Hemming
and hawing, he went toward the kitchen, but presently he came back.</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna and the devotees enjoyed the meal greatly. Afterwards he
rested awhile. About two o\'clock in the afternoon Pratap Chandra
Mazumdar of the Brahmo Samaj arrived. He was a co-worker of Keshab
Chandra Sen and had been to Europe and America in connection with the
Brahmo missionary work. He greeted Sri Ramakrishna, and the Master, too,
bowed before him with his usual modesty.</p>
<p>They were soon engaged in conversation.</p>
<p>PRATAP: \"I have been to Darjeeling recently for a change of air.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"But your health hasn\'t much improved. What are you suffering
from?\"</p>
<p>PRATAP: \"The same-illness that Keshab died of.\"</p>
<p>They began to talk about Keshab. Pratap said: \"Even in boyhood he
showed non-attachment to worldly things, seldom making merry with other
boys. He was a student in the Hindu College. At that time he became
friendly with Satyendra and through him made the acquaintance of his
father, Devendranath Tagore. Keshab cultivated bhakti and at the same
time practised meditation. At times he would be so much overcome with
divine love that he would become unconscious. The main purpose of his
life was to introduce religion among householders.</p>
<p>The conversation next turned to a certain Marhatta lady.</p>
<p>PRATAP: \"Some women of our country have been to England. This Marhatta
lady, who is very scholarly, also visited England. Later she embraced
Christianity. Have you heard her name, sir?\"</p>
<p><strong>Egotism brings calamity</strong></p>
<p>MASTER: \"No. But from what you say it seems to me that she has a desire
for name and fame. That kind of egotism is not good. The feeling \'I am
the doer\' is the outcome of ignorance. But the feeling that God does
everything is due to knowledge. God alone is the Doer; all others are
mere instruments in His hands.</p>
<p><strong>Parable of the calf</strong></p>
<p>\"The misfortune that befalls a man on account of his egotism can be
realized if you only think of the condition of the calf. The calf says,
\'Hamma! Hamma!\' that is, \'I! I!\' And just look at its misfortune! At
times it is yoked to the plough and made to work in the field from sunup
to sundown, rain or shine. Again, it may be slaughtered by the butcher.
In that case the flesh is eaten and the skin tanned into hide. From the
hide shoes are made. People put on these shoes and walk on the rough
ground. Still that is not the end of its misfortunes. Drums are made
from its skin and mercilessly beaten with sticks. At last its entrails
are made into strings for the bow used in carding cotton. When used by
the carder the string gives the sound \'Tuhu! Tuhu!\', \'Thou!
Thou!\'-that is, \'It is Thou, O Lord! It is Thou!\' It no longer says,
\'Hamma! Hamma!\', \'I! I!\' Only then does the calf\'s trouble come to
an end, and it is liberated. It doesn\'t return to the world of action.</p>
<p>\"Likewise, when the embodied soul says: \'O God, I am not the doer;
Thou art the Doer. I am the machine and Thou art its Operator\', only
then does its suffering of worldly life come to an end; only then does
it obtain liberation. It no longer has to be reborn in this world of
action.\"</p>
<p>A DEVOTEE: \"How can a man get rid of his ego?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"You cannot get rid of it until you have realized God. If you
find a person free from ego, then know for certain that he has seen
God.\"</p>
<p><strong>Signs of God-vision</strong></p>
<p>DEVOTEE: \"What, sir, are the signs of God-vision?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Yes, there are such signs. It is said in the Bhagavata that a
man who has seen God behaves sometimes like a child, sometimes like a
ghoul, sometimes like an inert thing, and sometimes like a madman.</p>
<p>\"The man who has seen God becomes like a child. He is beyond the three
gunas; he is unattached to any of them. He behaves like a ghoul, for he
maintains the same attitude toward things holy and unholy. Again, like a
madman, he sometimes laughs and sometimes weeps. Now he dresses himself
like a dandy and the next moment he goes entirely naked and roams about
with his cloth under his arm. Therefore he seems to be a lunatic. Again,
at times he sits motionless like an inert thing.\"</p>
<p><strong>Harmless ego</strong></p>
<p>DEVOTEE: \"Does the ego disappear altogether after the realization of
God?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Yes, sometimes God totally effaces the ego of His devotee, as
in the state of samādhi.</p>
<p>But in many cases He keeps a trace of ego. But that doesn\'t injure
anybody. It is like the ego of a child. A five-year-old child no doubt
says \'I\', but that ego doesn\'t harm anybody. At the touch of the
philosopher\'s stone, steel is turned into gold; the steel sword becomes
a sword of gold.</p>
<p>The gold sword has the form of a sword, no doubt, but it cannot injure
anybody. One cannot cut anything with a gold sword.</p>
<p>(To Pratap) \"You have been to England. Tell us what you saw there.\"</p>
<p>PRATAP: \"The English people worship what you call \'gold\'. Of course,
there are also some good people in England, those who live an unattached
life. But generally one finds there a great display of rajas in
everything. I saw the same thing in America.\"</p>
<p><strong>Secret of work</strong></p>
<p>MASTER (to Pratap): \"It is not in England alone that one sees
attachment to worldly things. You see it everywhere. But remember that
work is only the first step in spiritual life. God cannot be realized
without sattva-love, discrimination, kindness, and so on. It is the very
nature of rajas to involve a man in many worldly activities. That is why
rajas degenerates into tamas. If a man is entangled in too many
activities he surely forgets God. He becomes more and more attached to
\'woman and gold\'.</p>
<p>\"But it is not possible for you to give up work altogether. Your very
nature will lead you to it whether you like it or not. Therefore the
scriptures ask you to work in a detached spirit, that is to say, not to
crave the work\'s results. For example, you may perform devotions and
worship, and practise austerities, but your aim is not to earn people\'s
recognition or to increase your merit.</p>
<p>\"To work in such a spirit of detachment is known as karmayoga. But it
is very difficult. We are living in the Kaliyuga, when one easily
becomes attached to one\'s actions. You may think you are working in a
detached spirit, but attachment creeps into the mind from nobody knows
where. You may worship in the temple or arrange a grand religious
festival or feed many poor and starving people. You may think you have
done all this without hankering after the results. But unknown to
yourself the desire for name and fame has somehow crept into your mind.
Complete detachment from the results of action is possible only for one
who has seen God.\"</p>
<p><strong>The path of bhakti for this age</strong></p>
<p>A DEVOTEE: \"Then what is the way for those who have not seen God? Must
they give up all the duties of the world?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"The best path for this age is bhaktiyoga, the path of bhakti
prescribed by Nārada: to sing the name and glories of God and pray to
Him with a longing heart, \'O God, give me knowledge, give me devotion,
and reveal Thyself to me!\' The path of karma is extremely difficult.
Therefore one should pray: \'O God, make my duties fewer and fewer; and
may I, through Thy grace, do the few duties that Thou givest me without
any attachment to their results! May I have no desire to be involved in
many activities!\'</p>
<p>\"It is not possible to give up work altogether. Even to think or to
meditate is a kind of work.</p>
<p>As you develop love for God, your worldly activities become fewer and
fewer of themselves. And you lose all interest in them. Can one who has
tasted a drink made of sugar candy enjoy a drink made of ordinary
molasses?\"</p>
<p><strong>First God and then worldly duties</strong></p>
<p>A DEVOTEE: \"The English people always exhort us to be active. Isn\'t
action the aim of life then?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"The aim of life is the attainment of God. Work is only a
preliminary step; it can never be the end.</p>
<p>Even unselfish work is only a means; it is not the end.</p>
<p>\"Sambhu Mallick once said to me, \'Please bless me, sir, that I may
spend all my money for good purposes, such as building hospitals and
dispensaries; making roads, and digging wells.\' I said to him: \'It
will be good if you can do these things in a spirit of detachment. But
that is very difficult. Whatever you may do, you must always remember
that the aim of this life of yours is the attainment of God and not the
building of hospitals and dispensaries. Suppose God appeared before you
and said to you, \"Accept a boon from Me.\" Would you then ask Him, \"O
God, build me some hospitals and dispensaries\"? Or would you not rather
pray to Him: \"O God, may I have pure love at Your Lotus Feet! May I
have Your uninterrupted vision!\"? Hospitals, dispensaries, and all such
things are unreal. God alone is real and all else unreal. Furthermore,
after realizing God one feels that He alone is the Doer and we are but
His instruments. Then why should we forget Him and destroy ourselves by
being involved in too many activities? After realizing Him, one may,
through His grace, become His instrument in building many hospitals and
dispensaries.\'</p>
<p>\"Therefore I say again that work is only the first step. It can never
be the goal of life. Devote yourself to spiritual practice and go
forward. Through practice you will advance more and more in the path of
God. At last you will come to know that God alone is real and all else
is illusory, and that the goal of life is the attainment of God.</p>
<p><strong>The story of the wood-cutter</strong></p>
<p>\"Once upon a time a wood-cutter went into a forest to chop wood. There
suddenly he met a brahmachari. The holy man said to him, \'My good man,
go forward.\' On returning home the wood-cutter asked himself, \'Why did
the brahmachari tell me to go forward?\' Some time passed. One day he
remembered the brahmachari\'s words. He said to himself, \'Today I shall
go deeper into the forest.\' Going deep into the forest, he discovered
innumerable sandal-wood trees. He was very happy and returned with
cart-loads of sandal-wood. He sold them in the market and became very
rich.</p>
<p>\"A few days later he again remembered the words of the holy man to go
forward. He went deeper into the forest and discovered a silver-mine
near a river. This was even beyond his dreams. He dug out silver from
the mine and sold it in the market. He got so much money that he didn\'t
even know how much he had.</p>
<p>\"A few more days passed. One day he thought: \'The brahmachari didn\'t
ask me to stop at the silver-mine; he told me to go forward.\' This time
he went to the other side of the river and found a gold-mine. Then he
exclaimed: \'Ah, just see! This is why he asked me to go forward.\'</p>
<p>\"Again, a few days afterwards, he went still deeper into the forest and
found heaps of diamonds and other precious gems. He took these also and
became as rich as the god of wealth himself.</p>
<p><strong>Go forward</strong></p>
<p>\"Therefore I say that, whatever you may do, you will find better and
better things if only you go forward. You may feel a little ecstasy as
the result of japa, but don\'t conclude from this that you have achieved
everything in spiritual life. Work is by no means the goal of life. Go
forward, and then you will be able to perform unselfish work. But again
I say that it is most difficult to perform unselfish work. Therefore
with love and longing in your heart pray to God: \'O God, grant me
devotion at Thy Lotus Feet and reduce my worldly duties. Please grant me
the boon that the few duties I must do may be done in a detached
spirit.\' If you go still farther you will realize God.</p>
<p>You will see Him. In time you will converse with Him.\"</p>
<p>Next the conversation turned to the quarrels among the members of the
Brahmo Samaj. They had had a misunderstanding about the right to preach
in the temple after Keshab\'s death.</p>
<p>MASTER (to Pratap): \"I hear that some members of the Samaj have
quarrelled with you about the altar. But they are most insignificant
persons-mere nobodies.</p>
<p>(To the devotees): \"People like Pratap and Amrita are like good
conchshells, which give out a loud sound. And the rest, about whom you
hear so much, don\'t give out any sound at all.\" (All laugh.)</p>
<p>PRATAP: \"Speaking of sounds, even such a worthless thing as a
mangostone makes a sound!\"</p>
<p>MASTER (to Pratap): \"One can very well understand the inner feeling of
a teacher of your Brahmo Samaj by hearing his preaching. Once I went to
a meeting of a Hari Sabha. The preacher of the day was a pundit named
Samadhyayi. And can you imagine what he said? He said in the course of
his sermon: \'God is dry. We must make Him sweet and fresh with our love
and devotion.\' I was stunned to hear these words. Then I was reminded
of a story. A boy once said: \'At my uncle\'s house there are many
horses. Oh, yes! His whole cow-shed is full of them.\' Now if it was
really a cow-shed, then horses could not be kept there. Possibly he had
only cows. What did people think on hearing such an incoherent
statement? They believed that there were surely no such animals as
horses in the shed.\" (Laughter.)</p>
<p>A DEVOTEE: \"True, sir, there were not only no horses, but possibly
there were also no cows!\"</p>
<p>(Laughter.)</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Just fancy, to describe God, who is of the very nature of Love
and Bliss, as dry! It only proves that the man has never experienced
what God is like.</p>
<p><strong>Master\'s advice to Pratap</strong></p>
<p>(To Pratap) \"Let me tell you something. You are a learned and
intelligent and serious-minded soul. Keshab and you were like the two
brothers, Gaur and Nitai. You have had enough of lectures, arguments,
quarrels,discussions, and dissensions. Can such things interest you any
more? Now gather your whole mind and direct it to God. Plunge deep into
God.\"</p>
<p>PRATAP: \"Yes, sir, you are right. That is surely my only duty now. But
I am doing all these things only to perpetuate Keshab\'s name.\"</p>
<p>MASTER (with a smile): \"No doubt you say now that you are doing all
this to keep his name alive; but in a few days you won\'t feel that way.
Listen to a story. A man had built a house on a hill.</p>
<p>It was only a mud hut, but he had built it with great labour. A few days
after, there came a violent storm and the hut began to rock. The man
became very anxious to save it and prayed to the god of the winds,\'O
god of the winds, please don\'t wreck the house!\' But the god of the
winds paid no heed to his prayer. The house was about to crash. Then he
thought of a trick. He remembered that Hanuman was the son of the god of
the winds. At once he cried out with great earnestness: \'O revered sir,
please don\'t pull down the house. It belongs to Hanuman. I beseech you
to protect it.\' But still the house continued to shake violently.
Nobody seemed to listen to his prayer. He repeated many times, \'Oh,
this house belongs to Hanuman!\' But the fury of the wind did not abate.
Then he remembered that Hanuman was the devoted servant of Rāma, whose
younger brother was Lakshmana. Desperately the man prayed, crying aloud,
\'Oh, this house belongs to Lakshmana!\' But that also failed to help
matters. So the man cried out as a last resort: \'This is Rāma\'s house.
Don\'t break it down, O god of the winds! I beseech you most humbly.\'
But this too proved futile, and the house began to crash down. Whereupon
the man, who now had to save his own life, rushed out of it with the
curse: \'Let it go! This is the devil\'s own hut!\'</p>
<p>(To Pratap): \"You don\'t have to perpetuate Keshab\'s name. Remember
that he achieved all his success through the will of God. Through the
divine will his work was established, and through the divine will it is
disintegrating. What can you do about it? Now it is your bounden duty to
give your entire mind to God, to plunge deep into the Ocean of His
Love.\"</p>
<p>Saying these words the Master sang in his sweet voice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Dive deep, O mind, dive deep in the Ocean of God\'s Beauty; If you
descend to the uttermost depths, There you will find the gem of Love.</em></p>
<p><em>Go seek, O mind, go seek Vrindāvan in your heart,</em></p>
<p><em>Where with His loving devotees</em></p>
<p><em>Sri Krishna sports eternally.</em></p>
<p><em>Light up, O mind, light up true wisdom\'s shining lamp,</em></p>
<p><em>And let it burn with steady flame</em></p>
<p><em>Unceasingly within your heart.</em></p>
<p><em>Who is it that steers your boat across the solid earth?</em></p>
<p><em>It is your guru, says Kubir;</em></p>
<p><em>Meditate on his holy feet.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Master continued, addressing Pratap: \"Did you listen to the song?
You have had enough of lectures and quarrels. Now dive deep into the
Ocean of God. There is no fear of death from plunging into this Ocean,
for this is the Ocean of Immortality. Don\'t think that this will make
you lose your head. Never for a moment harbour the idea that by thinking
too much of God one becomes insane. Once I said to Narendra\"</p>
<p>PRATAP: \"Who is Narendra, sir?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Oh, never mind. There is a young man of that name. I said to
Narendra: \'Look here, my boy. God is the Ocean of Bliss; Don\'t you
want to plunge into this Ocean? Suppose there is a cup of syrup and you
are a fly. Where will you sit to sip the syrup?\' Narendra said, \'I
will sit on the edge of the cup and stick my head out to drink it.\'
\'Why?\' said I. \'Why should you sit on the edge?\' He replied, \'If I
go far into the syrup, I shall be drowned and lose my life.\' Then I
said</p>
<p>to him: \'But, my child, there is no such fear in the Ocean of
Satchidananda. It is the Ocean of Immortality. By plunging into it a man
does not die; he becomes immortal. Man does not lose his consciousness
by being mad about God.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge and ignorance</strong></p>
<p>(To the devotees) \"The feeling of \'I \' and \'mine\' is ignorance.
People say that Rani Rasmani built the Kāli temple; but nobody says it
was the work of God. They say that such and such a person established
the Brahmo Samaj; but nobody says it was founded through the will of
God. This feeling, \'I am the doer\', is ignorance. On the contrary, the
idea, \'O God, Thou art the Doer and I am only an instrument; Thou art
the Operator and I am the machine\', is Knowledge. After attaining
Knowledge a man says: \'O God, nothing belongs to me-neither this house
of worship nor this Kāli temple nor this Brahmo Samaj. These are all
Thine. Wife, son, and family do not belong to me. They are all Thine.\'</p>
<p>\"To love these objects, regarding them as one\'s own, is māyā. But to
love all things is daya, compassion. To love only the members of the
Brahmo Samaj or of one\'s own family is māyā; to love one\'s own
countrymen is māyā. But to love the people of all countries, to love the
members of all religions, is daya. Such love comes from love of God,
from daya.</p>
<p>\"Māyā entangles a man and turns him away from God. But through daya one
realizes God. Sages like Sukadeva and Nārada always cherished daya in
their hearts.\"</p>
<p>PRATAP: \"Revered sir, are those who live with you making progress in
spiritual life?\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"I tell people that there is nothing wrong in the life of the
world. But they must live in the world as a maidservant lives in her
master\'s house.\'</p>
<p>Referring to her master\'s house, she says, \'That is our house.\' But
her real home is perhaps in a far-away village. Pointing out her
master\'s house to others, she says, no doubt, \'This is our house\',
but in her heart she knows very well that it doesn\'t belong to her and
that her own house is in a faraway village. She brings up her master\'s
son and says, \'My Hari has grown very naughty\', or \'My Hari doesn\'t
like sweets.\' Though she repeats, \'My Hari\' with her lips, yet she
knows in her heart that Hari doesn\'t belong to her, that he is her
master\'s son.</p>
<p>\"Thus I say to those who visit me: \'Why don\'t you live in the world?
There is no harm in that.</p>
<p>But always keep your mind, on God. Know for certain that house, family
and property are not yours. They are God\'s. Your real home is in God.\'
Also I ask them to pray always with a longing heart for love of God\'s
Lotus Feet.\"</p>
<p>Again the conversation turned to the English people. A devotee said,
\"Sir, I understand that nowadays the pundits of England do not believe
in the existence of God.\"</p>
<p>PRATAP: \"However they may talk, I don\'t believe that any of them is a
real atheist. Many of them have had to admit that there is a great power
behind the activities of the universe.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Well, that is enough. They believe in Śakti, don\'t they? Then
why should they be atheists?\"</p>
<p>PRATAP: \"They also believe in the moral government of the universe.\"</p>
<p>Pratap was now about to take leave of the Master.</p>
<p>MASTER (to Pratap): \"What more shall I say to you? My only request is
that you do not involve yourself in quarrels and dissensions any more.
Another thing. It is \'woman and gold\' that keeps men away from God.
That is the barrier. Don\'t you find that everyone has nothing but
praise for his own wife? (All laugh.) A wife may be good or bad; but if
you ask her husband about her he will always say, \'Oh, she is very
good-\'\"</p>
<p>At this point Pratap bade the Master good-bye. He did not wait to hear
the end of Sri Ramakrishna\'s words about the renunciation of \"woman
and gold\". Those burning words touched the hearts of the devotees and
were carried away on the wind through the gently rustling leaves in the
garden.</p>
<p>A few minutes later Mani Mallick said to Sri Ramakrishna: \"Sir, it is
time for you to leave for Dakshineswar. Today Keshab\'s mother and the
other ladies of his family are going to the temple garden to visit you.
They will be hurt if they do not find you there.\"</p>
<p>Keshab had passed away only a few months before. His old mother and his
other relatives wanted to visit the Master.</p>
<p>MASTER (to Mani Mallick): \"Don\'t hurry me, please. I didn\'t sleep
well. I can\'t rush. They are going to Dakshineswar. What am I to do
about it? They will stroll in the garden and enjoy it thoroughly.\"</p>
<p>After resting a little the Master was ready to leave for Dakshineswar.
He was thinking of Surendra\'s welfare. He visited the different rooms,
softly chanting the holy name of God.</p>
<p>Suddenly he stood still and said: \"I didn\'t eat any luchi at meal
time. Bring me a little now.\"</p>
<p>He ate only a crumb and said: \"There is much meaning in my asking for
the luchi. If I should remember that I hadn\'t eaten any at Surendra\'s
house, then I should want to come back for it.\"</p>
<p>(All laugh.)</p>
<p>MANI MALLICK: \"That would have been nice. Then we too should have come
with you.\"</p>
<p>The devotees laughed.</p>
<p><strong>Friday, June 20, 1884</strong></p>
<p>It was dusk. Sri Ramakrishna was sitting in his room, absorbed in
contemplation of the Divine Mother. Now and then he was chanting Her
name. Rākhāl , Adhar, M., and several other devotees were with him.</p>
<p>After a while the evening worship began in the temples. Adhar left the
room to see the worship.</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna and M. conversed.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Tell me, does Baburam intend to continue his studies? I said
to him, \'Continue your studies to set an example to others.\' After
Sita had been set free, Bibhishana refused to become king of Ceylon.
Rāma said to him: \'You should become king to open the eyes of the
ignorant.</p>
<p>Otherwise they will ask you what you have gained as a result of serving
Me. They will be pleased to see you acquire the kingdom.\'</p>
<p><strong>Baburam\'s spiritual nature</strong></p>
<p>\"I noticed the other day that Baburam, Bhavanath, and Harish have a
feminine nature. In a vision I saw Baburam as a goddess with a necklace
around her neck and with woman companions about her.</p>
<p>He has received something in a dream. His body is pure. Only a very
little effort will awaken his spiritual consciousness.</p>
<p><strong>Concerning Rākhāl</strong></p>
<p>\"You see, I am having some difficulty about my physical needs. It will
be nice if Baburam lives with me. The nature of these attendants of mine
is undergoing a change. Lātu is always tense with spiritual emotion. He
is about to merge himself in God. Rākhāl is getting into such a
spiritual mood that he can\'t do anything even for himself. I have to
get water for him. He isn\'t of much service to me.</p>
<p>\"Among the youngsters Baburam and Niranjan are rather exceptional. If
other boys come in the future, they will, it seems to me, receive
instruction and then go away.</p>
<p>\"But I don\'t want Baburam to tear himself away from his family. It may
make trouble at home.</p>
<p>(Smiling) When I ask him, \'Why don\'t you come?\' he says, \'Why not
make me come?\' He looks at Rākhāl and weeps. He says, \'Rākhāl is very
happy here.\'</p>
<p>\"Rākhāl now lives here as one of the family. I know that he will never
again be attached to the world. He says that worldly enjoyments have
become tasteless to him. His wife came here on her way to Konnagar. She
is fourteen. He too was asked to go to Konnagar, but he didn\'t go. He
said,</p>
<p>\'I don\'t like merriment and gaiety.\'</p>
<p>\"What do you think of Niranjan?\" M: \"He is very handsome.\"</p>
<p><strong>Niranjan\'s guilelessness</strong></p>
<p>MASTER: \"No, I am not asking about his looks. He is guileless. One can
easily realize God if one is free from guile. Spiritual instruction
produces quick results in a guileless heart. Such a heart is like well
cultivated land from which all the stones have been removed. No sooner
is the seed sown than it germinates. The fruit also appears quickly.</p>
<p>\"Niranjan will not marry. It is \'woman and gold\' that causes
entanglement. Isn\'t that so?\"</p>
<p>M: \"Yes, sir.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"What will one gain by renouncing betel-leaf and tobacco? The
real renunciation is the renunciation of \'woman and gold.\'</p>
<p>\"I came to know in an ecstatic mood that, though Niranjan had accepted
a job in an office, he would not be stained by it. He is earning money
for his mother. There is no harm in that.</p>
<p>\"The work you are doing won\'t injure you either. What you are doing</p>
<p>is good. Suppose a clerk is sent to jail; he is shut up there and
chained, and at last he is released. Does he cut capers after his
release? Of course not. He works again as a clerk. It is not your
intention to accumulate money. You only want to support your family.
Otherwise, where will they go?\"</p>
<ol>
<li>\"I shall be relieved if someone takes charge of them.\" MASTER:
    \"That is true. But now do \'this\' as well as \'that\' \"</li>
</ol>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
1.  \"It is great luck to be able to renounce everything.\"</p>
<p>MASTER: \"That is true. But people act according to their inherent
tendencies. You have a few more duties to perform. After these are over
you will have peace. Then you will be released. A man cannot easily get
out of the hospital once his name is registered there. He is discharged
only when he is completely cured.</p>
<p><strong>Two classes of Master\'s devotees</strong></p>
<p>\"The devotees who come here may be divided into two groups. One group
says, \'O God, give me liberation.\' Another group, belonging to the
inner circle, doesn\'t talk that way. They are satisfied if they can
know two things: first, who I6 am; second, who they are and what their
relationship to me is. You belong to this second group; otherwise. . .</p>
<p>\"Bhavanath, Baburam, and a few others have a feminine nature. Harish
sleeps in a woman\'s cloth.</p>
<p>Baburam says that he too likes the womanly attitude. So I am right.
Bhavanath also is like that.</p>
<p>But Narendra, Rākhāl , and Niranjan have a masculine nature.</p>
<p><strong>Significance of the Master\'s injuring his arm</strong></p>
<p>\"Please tell me one thing. What is the significance of my having hurt
my arm? Once my teeth were broken while I was in a state of ecstasy. It
is the arm this time.\"</p>
<p>Seeing M. silent, the Master himself continued the conversation.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"My arm was broken in order to destroy my ego to its very root.
Now I cannot find my ego within myself any more. When I search for it I
see God alone. One can never attain God without completely getting rid
of the ego. You must have noticed that the chatak bird has its nest on
the ground but soars up very high.</p>
<p>\"Captain says I haven\'t acquired any occult powers because I eat fish.
I tremble with fear lest I should acquire those powers. If I should have
them, then this place would be turned into a hospital or a dispensary.
People would flock here and ask me to cure their illness. Is it good to
have occult powers?\"</p>
<ol>
<li>\"No, sir. You have said to us that a man cannot realize God if he
    possesses even one of the eight occult powers.\"</li>
</ol>
<p>MASTER: \"Right you are. Only the small-minded seek them. If one asks
something of a rich man, one no longer receives any favour from him. The
rich man doesn\'t allow such a person to ride in the same carriage with
him. Even if he does, he doesn\'t allow the man to sit near him.
Therefore love without any selfish motive is best.</p>
<p>\"God with form and the formless God are both equally true. What do you
say? One cannot keep one\'s mind on the formless God a long time. That
is why God assumes form for His devotees.</p>
<p>\"Captain makes a nice remark in this connexion. He says that when a
bird gets tired of soaring very high it perches on a tree and rests.
First is the formless God, and then comes God with form.</p>
<p>\"I shall have to go to your house once. I saw in a vision that the
houses of Adhar, Balarām, and Surendra were so many places for our
forgathering. But it makes no difference to me whether they come here or
not.\"</p>
<ol>
<li>\"That\'s right. Why shouldn\'t it be so? One must feel misery if
    one feels happiness. But you are beyond both.\"</li>
</ol>
<p>MASTER: \"Yes. Further, I think of the magician and his magic. The
magician alone is real. His magic is illusory, like a dream. I realized
this when I heard the Chandi recited. Sumbha and Nisumbha were scarcely
born when I learnt that they both were dead.\"</p>
<ol>
<li>\"Yes, sir. Once I was going to Kalna with Gangadhar in a steamer. A
    country boat struck our ship and sank with twenty or twenty-five
    passengers. They all disappeared in the water, like foam churned up
    by the steamer.</li>
</ol>
<p>\"May I ask you one thing? Does a man watching magic really feel
compassion when he sees suffering in the performance? Does he feel, at
that time, any sense of responsibility? One thinks of compassion only
when one feels responsibility. Isn\'t that so?\"</p>
<p><strong>How a Jnāni looks on the illusory world</strong></p>
<p>MASTER: \"A Jnāni sees everything at once-God, māyā, the universe, and
living beings. He sees that Vidyā-māyā, Avidyā-māyā, the universe, and
all living beings exist and at the same time do not exist. As long as he
is conscious of \'I\', he is conscious of \'others\' too. Nothing
whatsoever exists after he cuts through the whole thing with the sword
of jnāna. Then even his \'I\' becomes as unreal as the magic of the
magician.\"</p>
<p>M. was reflecting on these words, when the Master said: \"Do you know
what it is like? It is as if there were a flower with twenty-five layers
of petals, and you cut them all with one stroke.</p>
<p>\"The idea of responsibility! Goodness gracious! Men like Sankaracharya
and Sukadeva kept the \'ego of Knowledge\'. It is not for man to show
compassion, but for God. One feels compassion as long as one has the
\'ego of Knowledge\'. And it is God Himself who has become the \'ego of
Knowledge\'.</p>
<p><strong>Supreme power of <em>Ādyāśakti</em> in the relative world</strong></p>
<p>\"You may feel a thousand times that it is all magic; but you are still
under the control of the Divine Mother.</p>
<p>You cannot escape Her. You are not free. You must do what She makes you
do. A man attains Brahmajnana only when it is given to him by the
<em>Ādyāśakti</em>, the Divine Mother. Then alone does he see the whole thing
as</p>
<p>magic; otherwise not.</p>
<p>\"As long as the slightest trace of ego remains, one lives within the
jurisdiction of the <em>Ādyāśakti</em>. One is under Her sway. One cannot go
beyond Her.</p>
<p>\"With the help of the <em>Ādyāśakti</em>, God sports as an Incarnation. God,
through His Śakti, incarnates Himself as man. Then alone does it become
possible for the Incarnation to carry on His work.</p>
<p><strong>Everything is due to the Śakti of the Divine Mother.</strong></p>
<p>\"When anyone asked the former manager of the temple garden a great
favour, the manager would say, \'Come after two or three days.\' He must
ask the proprietor\'s permission.</p>
<p>\"God will incarnate Himself as Kalki at the end of the Kaliyuga. He
will be born as the son of a brahmin.</p>
<p>Suddenly and unexpectedly a sword and horse will come to him. . . .\"</p>
<p>Adhar returned to the Master\'s room after watching the evening worship
in the temples.</p>
<p>MASTER (to Adhar and the others): \"Bhuvan was here and brought me
twenty-five Bombay mangoes and some sweets. She said to me, \'Will you
eat a mango?\' I said, \'My stomach is heavy today.\' And to tell you
the truth, I am feeling uncomfortable after eating a few of the
sweets.\"</p>
<p>Bhuvanmohini was a nurse who used to visit Sri Ramakrishna now and then.</p>
<p>The Master could not eat the food offerings of everyone, especially of
physicians and nurses. It was because they accepted money from the sick
in spite of the suffering of these people.</p>
<p>MASTER: \"Keshab Sen\'s mother, sisters, and other relatives came here;
so I had to dance a little.</p>
<p>I had to entertain them. What else could I do? They were so
grief-stricken!\"</p>
